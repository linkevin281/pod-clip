In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Introduction,0.0,22.0,[Music] hi there I've just had the most incredible experience of my life having been allowed to interview saan Adella the CEO of Microsoft which is now the most valuable company in the world wow please tune in SAA you are the CEO of the most valuable company in the world what's what's on your mind these,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 001,,1.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Whats on your mind,22.0,129.0,the most valuable company in the world what's what's on your mind these days look to me um Nikolai first of all it's great to be with you and um have this conversation what's top of mind for me is twofold right one is I'm grounded in the fact that in our business in Tech business now this is my 32nd year at Microsoft um I know that for a fact that there's no such thing as a franchise value and so that means every day you have to get up and hopefully you're doing things that are going to be relevant tomorrow um and so to me that's sort of perhaps the biggest lesson learned over all these decades and years and so here we are on what is is essentially a complete new platform shift uh that we're in the midst of right I kind of say it's my 32nd year but it's year two of my fourth platform shift and so what's on mind is like okay what is this platform shift really all about and as a company can we be all in and innovate right I mean at the end of the day uh when I say there's no franchise value it also means that you get to play for it all up again even the battles we won and the battles we lost are all up for grab again and so therefore um there's a freshness to it so what's on my mind is you know that ability to ground myself back yet on on another platform shift and it's exciting the fact that there is no franchise value does that make you nervous absolutely I mean it should make every one of us nervous right at least that's why the tech is so exciting right it's sort of it's kind of like the two sides to the same coin right one is you're nervous and it's exciting so therefore you can't rest uh but at the same time hey who wants to be in in a business that you know where you don't get to reinvent yourself again and again,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 002,0.0,2.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,How can technology be a driver for economic growth,129.0,241.0,that you know where you don't get to reinvent yourself again and again absolutely do you think we look at Tech in two narrow a sense I mean how can technology really be a driver for the next level of economic growth yeah that's a great great question I think a lot about that right which is uh in some sense if you take at a GDP level uh Tech spend narrowly defined is probably 4 5% uh so the question is what is happening with the other 95% so one of the ways I've always thought about the prospects of any new technological Paradigm or platform shift like take AI let's I if AI is going to be the next big general purpose technology for me the real opportunity is let's say Tech spend goes from 5 to 10% over the next you know five years or what have you or 10 years then what happens to the other 90% And the pi does it become bigger right does the you know do we have a breakthrough in healthc care driven by AI do we have a breakthrough in material signs and energy transition because of uh AI uh and the list goes on right so to me that is fundamentally the way I think about it right which is I I think that one of the things that might be most important for us is to consider how a general purpose technology somebody was telling me this right which is in the height of the Industrial Revolution uh in the United Kingdom they spent 10% of their GDP building the railroads and obviously the railroads not just didn't is not about the railroads it was about the entire economy of the United Kingdom and so something like that I think is what uh that's the unit of analysis at least for me as to how Tech and its future will impact the in a broader society and,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 003,1.0,3.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Microsofts partnership with Open AI,241.0,391.0,me as to how Tech and its future will impact the in a broader society and economy now um Google had almost all the top AI people and you suddenly got ahead partly due to your partnership with open AI now how did that come about I mean um to me the way I came at this Nikolai is just very simple which is obviously we have been like I think the very first thing Microsoft research did in 1995 when it was formed was some stuff around speech right in fact I think we hired a bunch of the folks from CMU and so we've been at this AI thing in its variety of different forms forever um and so one of the things that when I met with the open AI folks and Sam and Greg and crew uh back in you know I would say when they were working even on the Dota 2 contest and what have you uh was to sort of say wow they have a new different approach to things and we wanted a partner I mean you know one of the things that I've always looked at over my years at Microsoft is look for high ambition um Technology Innovation companies right whether it you know or and partnership like whether it's Intel and windows came together and that was successful sap and SQL Server it came together and was successful so I'm always looking for partners that we can innovate with and that's what I found in uh Sam and team and uh and we you know at that time it was not like it was a it was a real uh in the dark right it is not like oh wow this is a sure sure thing everybody now talks about it as if uh you know this is the issue with tech right which is uh long before it's conventional wisdom you have to be all in and hope it works um and this is one of those things where we backed it long before it was conventional wisdom um and here we are but I don't take you know like there's going to be severe amount of competition you know Google's a very competent company and obviously they have both the talent and the compute and they have you know they're the vertically integrated player in this right they have everything from data to Silicon to models to have products and distribution and there's others as well and so yeah we will have significant amount of competition and I think if anything Microsoft's partnership with open AI is bringing more competition to otherwise what would have been a default Google should have be the default winner uh and if we partner well and we innovate well we can bring some competition to them so if you look 3 to,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 004,2.0,4.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Where is Microsoft in the AI ecosystem,391.0,558.0,innovate well we can bring some competition to them so if you look 3 to five years from now where is Microsoft in this whole AI ecosystem you think so to me I think about this in the fullness of the stack right so I want us to have first and foremost the best AI infrastructure uh so that means when it comes to Azure whether it's for training whether it's for inference to have fantastic infrastructure we'll partner with Nvidia we'll partner with AMD we'll have our own own silicon uh we will have our own system architecture we will take the best system architecture Innovation from Jensen and Lisa and others who may come along and make sure Azure is serving the needs of open AI serving the needs of Mistral uh serving the needs of fi that we are building right which is the small language model so that's kind of the first uh thing that we want to do which is the best work um in being able to build the infrastructure out for both training and inference and then the next layer up we want to have like the entire data tier right so you can imagine as these models and model capabilities become uh you know more capable I think the data tier will be completely uh redone uh right we've talked with the retrieval augmented generation already you have all these things where whether it's embeddings vctor search how do you chunk data such that retrieval augmented generation can work well so that's an entire l layer or when contact lens become bigger that's a different sort of data layer like what's the throughput between data and your inference Fleet uh how do you sort of think about that so therefore we will innovate on the data layer and then of course on top of it is where um we will innovate on our uh co-pilots one of the first products we built was get up co-pilot in fact my entire confidence in this generation of AI started when I started seeing from GPD 3 to 35 and that implementation in GitHub uh and so we now have you know not only GitHub co-pilot we have co-pilot for M all knowledge work in Microsoft 365 we have co-pilots for these functions whether it's service or sales or Finance uh so we're going to innovate in our app layer uh on our own and so that's I think fundamentally how I look at it it's it's a full stack approach uh and each layer by the way we're we will innovate we will have Partners we will have others innovating there will be competition even it's not like you know one of the things of being a platform company is you got to be comfortable with many third parties competing with you on different layers because that to me is core otherwise you kind of try to you know do everything in a monolithic way and at least what we've learned over the years is the best thing to do is to keep each layer competitive on its own you said in the beginning,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 005,3.0,5.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Year 2 of the Paradigm Shift,558.0,672.0,to do is to keep each layer competitive on its own you said in the beginning that we are year two into this Paradigm Shift uh how do you see it compared to other technological breakthroughs that we that you've been through so at least the four I've seen Nicolai is um obviously PC client server both what happened on the you know PC and the server side that was my first that's kind of when I joined 92 where at the beginning of that uh then there was the Web Internet uh and then there was mobile cloud and so AI is the fourth um I think one of the interesting things is each one of these built on the previous right so I don't think the web would have happened if there was not and you B his PC after all the first time I saw MOS uh you know was as a browser on top of Windows right so and then Netscape came about and then uh IE and what have you and so therefore I think um you sort of see each one of these births the next uh and then it goes beyond uh what births you right that's I think the the real thing right right now we're seeing that right which is the cloud um as we know of it and mobile uh and PCS on the edge have really birthed the AI age and the question is what happens next uh right which is does it go beyond that and that I think is going I mean there's going to be AI that is not just what about cognitive work AI that is also going to accelerate science so I think that that's a exciting space uh AI that is going to be embodied in the real world so what may happen in robotics is an exciting space and so there is a bunch of things that are going to happen over time uh but clearly yes this is year two of a complete new paradigm that obviously reinforces what happened pre or bills on what happened previously but also also is showing early signs of what happens next if,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 006,4.0,6.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Scaling Laws,672.0,772.0,previously but also also is showing early signs of what happens next if there had been no shortage of um uh chips now would the development have gone even faster that's a good question in the sense of scaling laws right so there are two sides to it right there's the the training side and the inference side on the training side clearly uh compute and compute scale and the scaling laws have proven to be very successful U and the question is how long does that go is there going to be another model architecture breakthrough or what have you um I I think that one has to see it's it's unclear uh but we definitely are not going to bet against scaling laws nor are we going to bet against uh or not are we going to say that this is the last Model architecture breakthrough in fact a great example of it is even uh what what we've we've seen even with uh our small language model Innovation like fi right which is we are able to create what is significant um capabilities uh in a small language model uh which uh doesn't require obviously the same amount of compute right which is uh like just like attention is everything attenti is all you need uh textbooks is all you need I mean that sort of intuitively speaks to uh how I think Co you know learning can happen and so therefore I would say uh yes if more more more capacity there is in the world the chances are that we will be able to make progress but at the same time I would discount a real breakthrough uh in model architecture that doesn't perhaps require uh the same type of compute so that's why I think um at least I want to keep myself open-minded about it talking of a small,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 007,5.0,7.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Small Language Models,772.0,857.0,at least I want to keep myself open-minded about it talking of a small language models do you think a small country like Norway should develop its own model you know one of the things that I've studied there's an economist out of darthmouth his name is Diego colan and he did one of the best longitudinal studies uh of Technology diffusion uh and the fundamental conclusion um paraphrasing was that any country that wants to get ahead should one first make sure that they don't reinvent the wheel which is they import the best general purpose technology that is available in and then on top of it build value ad so I think for example U even on for no way first thing I would do is if we feel like for whatever reason these Foundation models are not good at Norwegian or what have you then let's make sure they're fine-tuning and and there there are many things one could do even top of foundation models like an open eye model or a Mistral or what have you so there are ways you can add unique knowledge unique value on top of even what exists uh before you go off and say let's build all the compute all of it and do the same pre-training run uh you know there's no nothing stopping any country from doing any of this uh but the question is what is the value ad and so therefore I think that you start from the value ad and then back into whatever is needed for it when you look at how uh,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 008,6.0,8.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Tech in Geopolitics,857.0,950.0,the value ad and then back into whatever is needed for it when you look at how uh important the big technology companies have become in in geopolitics what kind of Reflections do you make well I mean at the end of the day um to two things right one is I'm very very grounded on the fact that we are a multinational company that is a definitely in this case a us-based multinational company that has to earn permission and license to operate one country at a time right so therefore I I think of the uh we're not nation states are the ones that have power we get to operate in any Nation based on our ability to contribute to that country's progress right so whenever I am right whether I'm in Norway or or I'm in Jakarta or or New Delhi or wherever I I am always grounded on uh fundamentally the fact is are we able to make you know look the local politicians and political leadership and Society at large in the eyes and say that we contributed to their public sector becoming more efficient or large multinational companies in the region becoming more globally competitive because of some tech input education outcome Health outcome small businesses and their productivity at the end of the day you have your your social contract with the country uh comes from your ability to contribute to their local progress and that so I don't think we we can ever be Beyond geopolitics will exist with or without us and our goal has to be how do you participate and have permission to,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 009,7.0,9.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Quantum Computing,950.0,1102.0,has to be how do you participate and have permission to operate moving on in your book um refresh you talk about three areas you talk about AI you talk about Quantum Computing and mixed reality so um how uh what kind of opportunities are you seeing in Quantum Computing it's fascinating in fact I I think of all those three still right for example when I think about um mixed reality I think of it as that's an embodied AI right effectively whether it's autonomous uh Vehicles robotics or people with glasses they're all seeing the real world is the prompt effectively so your real World understanding so therefore I think of in the generation of AI some of these things become even more interesting and more important and we do need to broaden the aperture versus thinking narrowly of just one device or one form factor similarly Quantum is a fascinating thing when I I me mentioned science right one of the things I look at it and say is in order to make progress on science you need great insilico simulation Quantum is the ultimate breakthrough right so when we have a complete new system architecture cure that go breaks free of the one Nyon limitation uh you are then finally going to be able to simulate something like the Dynamics of a cell or a molecule right so that I think when you can do that then everything else even in terms of biology becomes more feasible the interesting thing is AI is kind of like an emulator of that simulator in other words you can kind of simplify the search space and we see this already Nikolai one of the things we did recently uh was um we have a of a model for Material Science which we use to generate a new novel compound which we then went and manufactured we worked with the Pacific National Lab locally here to effectively go reduce the uh the the lithium content uh by 70% in a new battery material uh and produced it right not just conceptualized it but simulated It produced it and so to me uh something where like Quantum plus AI I think can be the ultimate accelerator of science uh and we are making progress right we will even on Quantum we're taking a very full stack approach we have our software stack with uh you know our Q sharp which is our Quantum programming stack so we are excited about sort of the progress we're making on Quantum and how it complements Ai and,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 010,8.0,10.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Gaming,1102.0,1234.0,about sort of the progress we're making on Quantum and how it complements Ai and where does the gaming fit into this yeah so to me one of the things in fact Microsoft was in gaming long before we you know we were into windows in fact flight simulator I think was launched long before Windows was launched so uh we are very very excited obviously now with Activision as part of Microsoft we have Mobile gaming we have cloud gaming we have console gaming PC gaming so we are a full stack game publ publisher uh as well as a game systems provider um and so our goal there is one we're in gaming for our love of gaming right so I always sort of say we should never be in businesses as a means to someone other end it has to be an end otherwise it's not a business so to me gaming uh is something where we want to bring joy of gaming that's the one pure consumer entertainment category I love the fact that gaming on a secular basis is probably going to be if not already the biggest entertainment category out there so that's one and of course it has real implications on the rest of it right if you think about even remember it's interesting I'm not talk to Jensen about it but one of the greatest sort of success es of gpus was fostered by innovation in gaming right DX which was the Microsoft graphic stack is what made gpus uh an accelerator uh right after all the gpus were created for PC gaming you know gaming I think as both a an application of AI in terms of like game testing one of the first areas I'm very excited about is games are so complicated right now one of the things that we want to use I is to be able to find these bugs in these even closed worlds uh before they're out there and so therefore we have some very great use cases there uh but beyond that I think gaming as uh data in the context of some of the Innovation uh in our models I think is going to be important do you game yourself I'm a you know a light gamer I used to do a lot more of Civ was my favorite game Age of Empires is a another great game that I enjoyed I wish I could play more uh but you know from time to time I slip into,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 011,9.0,11.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Changes at Microsoft,1234.0,1510.0,I could play more uh but you know from time to time I slip into it um you have really changed the culture at Microsoft when you look back what do you think are the most important changes you made look I mean Nicola I sort of first of all I've as I said I've grown up all my professional career for most part is all Microsoft so uh you know when you say I've being at Microsoft for 30 two years all the good the bad uh I was part of it right so I don't sort of somehow think that uh I'm I don't repes I represent all errors of Microsoft yeah which makes it even more incredible that you have made these changes yeah and the way though I came about it is quite frankly as a consumate Insider I basically pattern matched as to hey what were the thing when were we at our best uh what was the cultural set of attributes that helped us succeed and then when we failed what were the cultural attributes that caused that failure and then you know dampen this latter and amplify the former that was as simple as that so one of the things I look back even in my you know career at Microsoft when we first became the largest market cap company I forget I think in the early 2000s I think we crossed G you know people on our campus prob were walking around including me thinking oh we must be God's gifts uh to humankind uh because we are so brilliant and what have you except what we needed to be grounded on that day was to say wow we now have a real responsibility to reground ourselves to innovate again uh so that we are relevant in the future right and so that's why I I was lucky enough to have read Carol D's book on mindset which is around child psychology called growth mindset and I love that book I read it more on the context of sort of our children's education but I must say I got educated because I felt like this is uh what makes uh individuals children in school it's very clear right it's better to be a learn it all versus a know it all because even if the know it all has great innate capability uh the learn it all you know even if they start from behind they will surpass the know-it-all right that's sort of uh you know true for children in school it's true for CEOs in my seat uh it's true for companies and so we took that approach Nikolai we said let's be a learn it all versus annoy it all uh and the day you say you've achieved that cultural transformation means you're Anno it all so therefore it is a good way to sort of say every day you make a bunch of mistakes you at least have the courage to acknowledge them and continue on it and so it's a it's not a destination you ever reach but how do you get the the uh organization to buy into that how do you get it to penetrate down towards the Perma Frost in the organization it's a beautiful it's a great point so I think the way I I I think see the problem of Corporations especially for non-founder companies and Founders have great power and great followership and that's why I think they're so successful or at least you know at least we only talk about the successful Founders but if you set that that class aside for M modals like me uh it can't be like okay new Dogma from a new CEO and more corporate spe it has to appeal to us as human beings that's why I you know I credit more of this work uh by Carol and team and so on because it's not like it was not like I don't think anybody at Microsoft views growth mindset as some Microsoft Dogma or definitely not Saia Adela Dogma it is something that speaks to them as humans right which is it's good for them as friends colleagues Partners parents neighbors it integrates work in life they can bring their own personality and passion to it uh and benefit from it right I I always say like you're not do like this Microsoft culture of growth mindset is not for Microsoft it's for you and if you you should only practice it if you feel like it speaks to your own thriving at Microsoft and in life uh that's I think what I attribute it to right it wouldn't have taken off if it was just another thing that is a topdown slogan uh it is ult I always have believed that which is ultimately people work um and Find meaning in work uh only if they can find some true deeper meaning for themselves and so that's I think what I've been always trying to,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 012,10.0,12.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Empathy,1510.0,1625.0,meaning for themselves and so that's I think what I've been always trying to invoke well they clearly also have found um true deeper meaning in in the concept of empathy because uh you talked a lot about that and you say that it's key to Innovation and Leadership and so on so what do you um why why is that why is it so important for you I think about this as um I think most people think of empathy as some kind of a soft skill that's interesting in the context of your family or personal life and works all about hardcore you know whatever right but that but I look at that and say again what is where is innovation come from right Innovation comes from us being able to drive the solutions to unmet unarticulated needs of customers out there right so the key being unmet and unarticulated so that means you have to have a better sense when you're even looking at some log data or you know some customer interview data or whatever you it's not just the words that they're saying but you got to be able to walk in their shoes uh and the good news there is this is innate in us all human beings we have uh the ability to empathize with the other person um in fact design thinking is that right so when people go and say let's do learn about design thinking design thinking is applied empathy uh and so to me uh that's what I pull the thread on which is let's not think of empathy as something that you know is just a soft skill that you reserve for your friends and family but it's I think it's at the root of all Innovation uh it's about being able to meet the unmet unarticulated needs that comes from your unique I mean your innate ability to have curiosity to learn about others walk in their shoes innovate on their behalf uh and that I think is I think what we have to do and that's why I I think empathy is an important important skill for all of us when did you first,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 013,11.0,13.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Lifes experiences,1625.0,1760.0,empathy is an important important skill for all of us when did you first discover the power of empathy I mean I I read your book fantastic book you talk very warmly about your mother she being very empathetic yeah and you know I think that one of the things that I I feel like all of us learn how to turn on this bit of empathy through life's experience right so in some sense every day you get confronted with different circumstances not just yourself personally but people around you uh for me obviously the birth of my son uh for both my wife and me was uh was a life-changing event and was something that uh you know over the years I at least learned a lot because I I I remember in the early days it was all about sort of my son was born with cbal poliy he passed away a few years ago uh and um uh but you know in the when when he was born it was a lot about what happened to me I was sort of you know essentially quote unquote um you know in you know all about why did this happen to us why did it happen to me how and then I realized after watching in some sense my wife uh who was there as a caregiver as a parent uh you know taking him up and down Seattle to every therapy possible uh quite frankly you know it took me years not you know days or months or weeks um and um and then I realized that nothing had happened to me but something had happened to my son and I needed to be there for my son and that is the experience I talk a lot about but there's experiences like that every day right some colleague of mine comes with some you know parent of theirs who needs care right that sort of you know I learn from it I or at least let me put it this way I am more a tuned to learning from other people's experiences today than I was in the beginning of my career and I think that happens to all of us right which is life's experiences if they they ACW uh that ability to build a deeper empathy for other people and that also helps you be a better manager a better coworker a better uh innovator yeah thanks for sharing do you,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 014,12.0,14.0
In Good Company,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management,Empathy and execution,1760.0,1974.0,coworker a better uh innovator yeah thanks for sharing do you um think there is a contradiction between empathy and execution I don't right I think that at the end of the day to me you have to take accountability right so this is one of the things that uh in business um like in life too right uh you have to be accountable for making real progress uh one of the things I think about why do businesses exist businesses exist at least I like this Colin mayor definition that you have to create profitable solution to challenge of people in Planet uh because that's at least a good way to allocate the global resources that are available right the profit motive is a good motive because it means you're competing and allocating resources in the most efficient ways and uh and face competition and so therefore you have to have great execution you have to have great accountability and so I think of empathy as a necessary condition to create great solutions that are profitable and that are competitive solutions that are winning in the marketplace as opposed to somehow this being a tradeoff when you look at your your your skill set and your personality what do you think it is that makes you so effective as a leader I mean first of all right I I I don't think of this as I I don't know I have causality here well understood because quite frankly it's so much easier for others to app Pine on this than or rather it's it's just really for others to judge and assign uh causality there but the way at least I come at this is I don't start with uh what am I good at I am very keenly shaped by what am I not good at uh in other words I'm always looking what can I learn from someone else so if there's one attribute I have I don't start each day by thinking oh all the stuff I know and I'm good at I'm like wow what am I weak at whom do I talk to whom do I meet how do I really shape the colleagues around me who have better skills than me on many fronts uh that's what I'm wired like maybe that helps but I don't know whether that's the causality but I don't start each day was saying wow I'm so good at this so therefore I'm GNA go do this no I come at the exact opposite is it something you learned from is this something you learned from Bill Gates because he said the same thing right he's a he's really a Le I don't know I mean it's a good point both Bill and Steve uh there is uh there's a sense at Microsoft I think that that's an interesting thing we're going to be 50 years next year um there is you know what Andy Gro would talk the paranoid survive or what have you um and I don't come at it but though with paranoia right I I mean I don't like paranoia I like this just that's why I go back to my own words for this is that's why the the growth mindset or confronting your own fixed mindset having confidence that wow what an unbelievable world we live in that every customer can teach me every partner can teach me every colleague can teach me like what more can I ask for in life uh so it's not paranoia it's not like oh wow we have to go in every day uh that if I don't learn something I'll you know fail I'm more about like what do I learn so that I can innovate maybe uh that's how I come at it and that's right Bill and Steve in their own unique way uh had that mindset and so I've grown up around it and how do you install that kind of I,Satya Nadella - CEO of Microsoft | In Good Company | Podcast | Norges Bank Investment Management - 015,13.0,15.0

No Priors,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase,Managing an open source environment,105.0,270.0,one thing that we talked about the last time we saw each other in person was just how quickly like the AI um ecosystem and research field is evolving and what it means to manage an open source project through that can you talk a little bit about what you decide to keep stable and change when you both have like big ecosystem of users now and like very rapidly changing environment of applications and Technology that's been a fun exercise so I mean if we go back to the original version of Lang chain what it was when it came out was essentially three kind of like highlevel implementations two were based on research papers and then one was based on natat fredman's like gbot type of agent web crawler thing and so there was some high level kind of like abstractions and then there was a few like Integrations so we had Integrations with I think like open Ai cohere and hugging face to start or something like that and those two layers have kind of like remained so we have you know 700 different Integrations we have a bunch of kind of like higher level chains and agents for for doing particular things I think the thing that we've put a lot of emphasis in um to your point around kind of like what's remained constant and what's remains uh and what's changed is like a lower level kind of like abstraction and runtime for for joining these things together one of the things that we pretty quickly saw was that as people wanted to improve the performance go from prototype to production they wanted to customize a lot of these bits and so we've invested a lot in uh a lower level kind of like chaining protocol so laying chain expression language and then in in a different protocol laying graph which is one something we're really excited about and that's more aimed at uh basically graphs that are not dags so you know all these agents are basically running an llm in a loop you need Cycles um and so Lane graph helps with that and so I think what we've kind of seen is underlying bits of um there's all these different Integrations and like you know there's there's LMS Vector stores and sometimes they change right when chat models came out like that was a that's a very big change in the API interface and so we had to add a new abstraction for that but those have especially over the past few months remained relatively stable um we've invested a lot in this underlying runtime which emphasizes a few things uh streaming structured outputs and and the importance of those has remained relatively stable but then the way that you put things together and the kind of like patterns um for building things has definitely evolved over time from like simple chains to complex chains to then these kind of like autonomous agents to now something um maybe in the middle of like complex State machines or graphs or something and so it's really that upper layer which is like the common ways to put things together that I think we've seen the most rapid kind of like churn what do you think is still missing from uh really getting to performing agents there's a number of companies that have,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase - 002,18.0,20.0
No Priors,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase,Developing useful AI agents,270.0,603.0,uh really getting to performing agents there's a number of companies that have been started recently that are really focused on sort of the agentic world and pushing that whole thread in certain types of automation forward what do you use the big components that you all don't have or that maybe the industry more generally doesn't have that that still needs to come into place to help drive those things ahead yeah that's a that's a really good question I think there's a few things one I think like um like figuring out the right ux for a lot of these things is still an open question in my mind um and you know that's not necessarily something we can help with I think there's a lot of exploration that applications need to do to figure out how to you know communicate what these agents are good at and bad at to end users and expose ways to um maybe let them course correct and see what's going on and so you know I think we try to emphasize a lot of this um observability of intermediate steps and even correcting intermediate steps but but there's a lot of experimentation around ux that I think needs to happen um another big part I think is is basically the planning ability of the underlying llms um I think that's probably the biggest I think when we see people building agents that work right now it's often breaking it down into a bunch of smaller components and and kind of like imparting their domain knowledge about how information should flow through these components um because I think the Els by themselves still aren't able to to reason fully about how that should happen and I think we see a few kind of like uh a lot of research is actually around this I would say in the academic space specifically I think there are two different types of research papers around agents that we see we see some around like planning for agents so there's a bunch of papers that do kind of like an explicit planning Step Up Front um and then there are uh other research papers that do a bunch around reflection so like after it after uh an agent does something is this actually right how can I kind of like um you know improve upon that and I think both of those are basically trying to get around the shortcomings of llms and that in theory they should do that automatically right like you shouldn't have to ask an llm to plan or to think about whether what it's done is correct it should know to do that and then it can kind of like run in a cycle but we see a lot of shortcomings there um and so I think planning ability of llms is is is a big one and that'll get better over time the last one is maybe a little bit more vague but I think even just as Builders we're still figuring out the right ways how to make all these things work what's the right information flow between all the different nodes um in order to get those nodes which are typically an llm call to work do you want to do F shop prompting do you want to fine-tune models do you want to just work on improving the instructions and the prompt um and so I think there's a lot of uh how how do you test those nodes uh that's a big thing as well how do you get confidence in your llm systems and llm agents um and so I think there's a lot of workflow around that to to kind of like be discovered and figured out one thing that's sort of come up repeatedly Rel relative to agents has just been like memory and so I wasn't sure how you think about memory and implementing that and what that should look like and because it seems like there's a few different Notions that people have been putting forward and I think it's super interesting so I was just curious about your thinking on that I also think it's super interesting um I have a few thoughts here um so I think there's maybe two types of memory and they're and they're related but I'll draw some distinction between kind of like system level procedural memory and then like personalization type memory um so system level memory I mean more like what's the right way to use a tool what's the right way to accomplish this objective independent of of who exactly the person is and how I'm different than Sarah or something like that um and then for the personalization bit I think it's like okay you know Harrison likes soccer and he likes basketball and I should remember that when he asked questions um and so I think there's there's uh maybe slightly different ways that we see teams thinking about both of these so on the procedural side I think the main thing that we see people doing um and that we think is pretty effective is uh few shot prompting and maybe find tuning for how to use uh for how to use tools because that's basically what it comes down to what's the right way to use tools what's the right way to plan and we see F shot examples being really really impactful for that and so that's something where and so there I think there's this really interesting data flywheel of like monitoring your application Gathering good examples um and then and then plugging those back into your application in the form of few shot examples that we're pushing really heavily with laying Smith right now and then the other side of it is just like personalization level memory um and I think there's a few different ways to do this like I think open AI implemented it in their chat uh in their chat uh GPT where it in the way I think it does it under the hood is it basically has functions that it can call to say like remember this fact or delete this fact um and so that's a really interesting like active um active Loop that the agent is engaging in where it explicitly decides what it wants to remember and what it doesn't want to remember I also think one thing that I'm bullish on is a more kind of like uh passive background uh process that kind of looks at conversations and almost like extracts insights um and then you can use those insights in kind of like future conversations and I think there's pros and cons to each and I think it speaks to the memory in general I feel is like a field that's just like super super nent like I don't I actually am am underwhelmed at the amount of like really interesting stuff that's going on there um and so I think you know bunch of different approaches no no kind of like overwhelmingly best solution has the um sophistication shape type of,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase - 003,19.0,21.0
No Priors,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase,Sophistication and limitations of AI app development,603.0,857.0,like overwhelmingly best solution has the um sophistication shape type of application that you see people building with Lang chain or just generally in the ecosystem dramatically changed over the last few months I do think that there are more examples kind of as elad mentioned of um agentic applications that are much more productive and more sophisticated like multi-step rag systems with much more useful ranking like does that match with the patterns you're seeing or like what are you what are you seeing that excites you the most that you think is most useful that does generally match I think Lang chain from the beginning has always been focused on those types of applications um and and uh not only the open source but also Lang Smith the platform so I think you know a lot of the emphasis that we put into like the testing and the observability is really focused on these like multi-step things we've always been focused on those probably it's generally true in the market that there's been more uh uh of a trend towards those but from our perspective we've always been focused on those and so I think you know that hasn't been as dramatic I think there has been like interesting um things within that that have emerged just calling out like a few things um within rag I think we've seen really interesting and advanced query analysis start to come into play so uh you know you're not just passing the user question directly to an embedding model you're maybe doing some analysis on it to figure out which which retriever should I send it to or like what is the bit that I should search is there kind of like a explicit metadata filter so some and then so that retrieval is like a multi-step uh process and more there um and explicitly around query analysis um f shop prompting and that whole data flywheel I think we're starting to see come into play more on the agent side um I kind of alluded to this earlier but I think you know um the way that we've kind of thought about things is there's kind of like chains which are sequential steps you're going to do this and then you're going to do this and then you're going to do this and you're always going to do those in the exact sequence and then you know last March or April or whenever Auto GPD came out and it was like we're literally just going to run this in a for Loop and it's going to be you know this autonomous agent and I think the things that we see making it into production and and informed um a lot of the development of Lange graph um is are is something in the Middle where it's like this controlled State machine type thing um and so we've seen a lot of that come out recently and so i' maybe call out that as like one um thing that we've really updated a lot of our beliefs on over the past few months yeah I think a combination of that and Tre search and just like trying to be efficient with like your sampling at every step has shown like a lot of really interesting uh effective applications recently and I think the like cognition as one example of like a surprisingly amazing agent has has come out like where else do you think agent agentic applications will begin to work or that you've already seen I think on the customer support side that's a pretty obvious use case I think Sierra um you know has emerged there and is doing is doing quite well there um I think yeah the cognition demo was very impressive I think they did a lot of things right I think they really nailed a really interesting ux um and that was maybe one of the things that that I was most excited about um and then obviously it seems to work very well and so I I don't know exactly what they're doing under the hood um uh but but those type like coding coding problems in general we see a lot of people working on I think you there's a really nice feedback loop that you can get by just like executing the code and seeing if it works um and you know as well as the fact that people building it are developers and so they can they can uh test it um coding customer support there there's some interesting stuff around like recommend like recommendation um chat Bots almost um so I draw a distinction between that and customer support or with customer support you're maybe trying to explicitly kind of like resolve a ticket or something like that and the um and the recommendation bit is a bit more focused on like a user's preferences and and what they like um and I think we've seen a few uh I think we've seen a few things emerge there um but I'd say customer support and coding are the two Clara as well you know they came out and and had a pretty good release one um pattern that I think is very popular and I can't tell if it is real or transient is whether or not companies will be able to switch between,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase - 004,20.0,22.0
No Priors,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase,Switching between model APIs,857.0,1030.0,is real or transient is whether or not companies will be able to switch between different um llm models right whether it's a you know self-hosted like dedicated um uh inference um you know instance for for them or if it's an actual API provider but for any given application take your prompts and go from you know um anthropic to mraw to open AI to something else um in reality it feels like you know the way an application uh responds is probably going to be sensitive to the fact that these LMS are actually going to predict differently like what do you think about this can you can you switch is that a real pattern it's not as easy as it seems like it should be and I think the main main thing is that the prompts still need to be different um for each model I do think um the prompts will probably start to converge in the sense that if you think the models are getting more and more intelligent then like hopefully these small idiosyncratic EES don't matter as much um and as more and more model providers start supporting the same things um then that will make it easier and what I mean by that is you know so many prompts for open AI which is you know the leading and most used one use function calling um and you know up until some period ago like no other models did and so you just like couldn't use those prompts at all um but now like mraw has function calling and and and Google has function calling and so I think they're a little bit more transferable there what else is on that list there's function calling there's visual input like what else is going to differentiate these um model apis context Windows one as well so I think this gets to like yeah what's the right context that you can be passing if it's longer you know if that changes then changes that doesn't like that changes the whole architecture of your application um modalities one prompt injection for safety yeah I I think that's interesting um I think that's a real Enterprise concern I think a lot of the agents are still just figuring out how to make agents work this is a different axis almost but to the point around like switching models I do think we see a desire for this especially when you start going to scale um so I think it's like make something work with gp4 but then okay you're rolling it out are you really is that like you know are you really going to eat that much cost with gp4 can you use GPD 3.5 do you want to fine tune and so I think that's that like that transition is where we really start to see people um thinking about switching models um there's definitely some switching models at the beginning like if you just want to play around with different models and see their capabilities but I think the most like pressy need to switch models happens when you go from prototype to to scale cost and latency would be differentiators there as well one thing you mentioned I thought was really interesting is just context windows and obviously Gemini launched with um a million token context window and I was,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase - 005,21.0,23.0
No Priors,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase,"Context windows, fine tuning and functionality",1030.0,1297.0,million token context window and I was just curious um how you think about context window versus rag versus other aspects of the model and how all those things tie together and you know once we get to very long context windows and the tens of millions of tokens like does that really shift things radically or how does that change functionality and so I was just curious since you've thought about how all these things piece together um I was just curious how you think about those different factors and what they mean very good question that a lot of people are thinking about who are a lot smarter than me I think um I mean a few thoughts I think like longer context Windows definitely make like single shot things much more realistic um like extraction of elements in a long PDF you can do that one shot um rag over a single long PDF or like five long PDFs okay cool you can do that you can do that one shot there I think um there are definitely things at scale that don't fit um you know into a single uh uh context window there are also things where it requires iterations you need to like decide what to do interact with the environment get that back so this whole idea of chaining um and agents I don't like that's that's less around context windows and more around interacting with the environment and getting feedback and and so I don't think that's going anywhere um I think with respects to rag in particular because I think that's where it often comes up like you know did this kill rag um I think there's a few things actually just today one of our team members Lance Martin there's that like everyone's doing the needle in the Hast stack thing and now all these models are like green across the board for whatever reason they've all figured it out um but I think like that that actually really doesn't reflect a lot of rag use cases in in my opinion because like that's the needle in the Hast stack is like okay given this long context can I find a single information point but often times rag is about seeing multiple information points and then reasoning over them and so I think with the Benchmark he released is exactly that like as you increase the number of of needles um you know performance goes down as you might expect and then also when you ask it to reason rather than just retrieve the performance drops as well and so there I think there's more work to be done there and then I think another thing is just around the ingestion for rag in the in the indexing process like a lot of attention has been paid to like um Tex splitting and chunking and and and all of that and I don't know exactly how that will change like will you still do that but you now just retrieve the whole document like we have a concept in Lang chain of like a parent document retriever which basically creates multiple vectors for for each document so maybe you just do that maybe you still maybe you chunk it up into larger chunks and just retrieve those larger trunks maybe use a a traditional search engine like elastic search or something I'm not I'm I'm not sure that's probably the place I have the least confidence in the one other area that I see a lot of people talking about and I see a fewer people actually doing uh is fine tuning and um to some extent I think that's because with fine tunes you lose generalizability and so people just start focusing on prompt engineering or other ways to effectively get the same performance without the actual fine tune but it's something that feels very um Aaron and people talk about it a lot and people talk about doing it a lot um You probably have a great perspective since you see so many different types of customers are are you seeing a lot of fine tuning happening in the wild and if so there's specific common applications or use cases for it we see people experimenting with it I think the only real place where they're doing it is when they've reached like really critical scale um which I still don't think is that many applications to to date um I think there's a lot of difficulties with it um one's like Gathering the data set for it and so I think a lot of the things we have in link Smith tackle a lot of these issues but like Gathering the data set for it um so like having that data visibility and starting to curate that data set um evaluating the fine-tuned model um so like evaluation and testing is is a huge pain point there that we're trying to tackle in a few ways the third is just like yeah back to this point of people are still just like experimenting so rapidly it's much harder to change a fine-tuned model than it is to change a prompt or even changed few shot examples and so I think we're seeing more and more people use few shot examples um but not a ton graduating to the fine-tuning just because yeah I think uh much harder to just like iterate quickly on in terms of other major changes in the landscape it's been it's been a big year the first commit to Lang chain I think was in octob October of 22 which is like when I launched um conviction as a fund as well uh at that time we didn't have LL 2 we didn't have mraw there were not um,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase - 006,22.0,24.0
No Priors,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase,Evolution of AI open source environment,1297.0,1433.0,uh at that time we didn't have LL 2 we didn't have mraw there were not um nearly as many open-source models with um what people would consider to be more useful reasoning ability has that changed in terms of like what you see um application developers do with linkchain Gemini too oh and Gemini yeah fun story about that the original models that we launched with open AI actually deprecated like a month ago so the like actual original L chain you can't run because the models don't exist anymore um but yeah um like there's I think we see increasingly interest in open source but the reasoning abilities are still just like lagging behind clae 3 or gp4 um and I think like for a lot of the applications that it kind it probably depends on the types of applications that you're building but a lot of the applications that Lang train is focused on with this kind of like reasoning aspect those are just so crucial um and I don't think we see super compelling um I don't I still don't think we see super compelling reasoning abilities in the open source models and maybe that's one of my hot takes but I think for a lot of the Lang train apps the open source models maybe don't live up to a lot of kind of like the the Twitter hype or Twitter excitement at least not yet zooming out like you have really Broad View like what do you feel like that no one is working on that it's going to enable better applications that should be I think the most exciting stuff is at the application in ux Lay right now I think that's where the most exciting stuff is there one of the uh I don't know if this is this this is maybe this is in more the capabilities side is but like memory I think is super interesting especially like personalized long-term memory um I don't know if I don't know if it's necessarily tooling so much that needs to be built there as it's just like an application in a ux that's really focused on that um and and you know if I if I wasn't doing link chain if I was starting a company right now I'd probably start something at the application layer and it would probably be something that really takes advantage of like long-term memory I guess at the the high level similarly is there anything that you view as like a major prediction or things that'll change over the next year that nobody's really,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase - 007,23.0,25.0
No Priors,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase,The next big breakthroughs,1433.0,1652.0,prediction or things that'll change over the next year that nobody's really paying as much attention to memory is a big interest of of of ours um and so I hope that will have some kind of like breakthroughs there I think a lot of the specifically around yeah learning from interactions incorporating that back in at a user level um in a similar vein also this uh type of more like system level memory I think is really interesting and building up building towards this idea of almost like continual learning so there's you know like can you learn from your interactions and you can do that in a variety of different ways this may just be where we sit in the ecosystem but one exciting um and probably under talked about ways it's just idea of of building up F shot example data sets and really using those I think it's much faster and cheaper than fine-tuning models um it's easier to do than trying to like programmatically change the prompt in some way like that's still kind of like a a a bit of a art um and so yeah continual towards continual learning with few shot examples is is maybe one like really interesting area that that we're excited about can you help our listeners ex like just imagine like a little bit more vly like what um type of application experience that would enable like you know a consumer application or a business application of what that type of continuous learning would allow you to do yeah absolutely I think at a high level it would basically allow the application to automatically get better over time and it could get better in the sense that it's just more accurate so you know it's it maybe you know it first does a mistake you then like tell it that it made a mistake and it automatically kind of like incorporates that either as a few shot example or update to a prompt but it starts learning from its its mistakes and its successes as well right there's a really cool project called dpy or DSP I don't know how to pronounce it um but it's out of Stanford I say dispy oh no there's there's three ways now I say the aspa no I'm just kidding so and I think that actually tackles like I actually see a lot of similarities between that and Lang chain Lang Smith in some way and I think it's all towards this idea of like so so so dpy or disp or or whatever um is basically this idea of like optimization you have kind of like inputs outputs you then have your application which uh they similarly think as as like multiple steps and you basically uh you basically optimize your your application through a variety of different ways the main one of which I would say is probably F shot examples so they we'll probably do a webinar with Omar and he can correct me if I'm wrong um and I think the idea of like continual learning is basically doing that optimization but in an online manner where your feed you don't have like ground truth necessarily but you get feedback from the environment thumbs up thumbs down if if things are good and so I think yeah that kind of like optimization Loop whether offline or online is really really exciting and I think a similar thing could maybe I think you can think of like personalization also as like what this would look like to end users and and maybe like consumer facing apps so you start with like a generic application that does the same thing for everyone but then it maybe learns to to search the web differently for for me and elad or something like that um and so I think that's like concretely how it could could manifest cool thanks so much for doing this um it's obviously a pleasure to have you on no thank you guys good to see you find us on Twitter at no prior pod subscribe to our YouTube channel if you want to see our faces follow the show on Apple podcast Spotify or wherever you listen that way you get a new episode every week and sign up for emails or find transcripts for every episode at no- prior .c,No Priors Ep. 57 | With LangChain CEO and Co-Founder Harrison Chase - 008,24.0,
