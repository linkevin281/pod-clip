       "Document(page_content=\"today we're joined by EO Liberty CEO and\\nfounder of pine cone Pine cone's a\\nvector database that's raised over $130\\nmillion most recently at a $750 million\\nvaluation and they've really become a\\ncore part of the common set of tools\\nthat folks use to build AI apps we hit\\non a bunch of really interesting areas\\nincluding the vector database landscape\\nand how it's evolving common barriers\\nthat enterprises have to building\\neffective AI apps Ando also shared his\\nthoughts on the infrastructure and AI\\nopportunities ahead in the application\\nlayer as well I think folks are really\\ngoing to enjoy this definitely stick\\naround for patent my debrief here at\\nunsupervised learning\\nyou know thanks so much for uh for\\ncoming on really appreciate it thank you\\nguys you know you were obviously working\\non Pine Cone before this generative AI\\ncraze and you know the launch of chat\\nGPT and what was it like for you guys\\nwhen chat GPT came out I mean was it\\nlike immediately clear there's going to\\nbe some spike in usage or when did you\\nfirst kind of start observing just uh\\nthe insanity that I imagine followed\\nI'll start by saying that Vector bases I\\nthink are uh still vastly underutilized\\nfor a lot of use cases for semantic\\nsearch for candidate generation for\\nranking for feed ranking for like\\nrecommendation for a million different\\nthings right when I started building\\nPine con this was really it was sort of\\nlike a well-kept secret well a\\nwell-known secret I should say that the\\nbigger companies like Google Amazon you\\nknow whatever like use that\\ninternally for search for recommendation\\nfor feed ranking for anomaly detection\\nand so on but then educating the market\\nwas fairly difficult and I would go to\\nyou know investors and say you know\\ndatabase and they would kind of look at\\nme confused and and concerned and I'm\\nsure they emailed you in in 2023 and\\nthey were like we believed all along\\nright we've always been fans of the\\ncategory yeah uh actually I'll tell you\\nfunny a funny thing that I the actual\\nemails I got after that but just to make\\nmatters worse I had just come out of AWS\\nwhere I I helped build a product called\\nsag maker which was EML Ops thing and\\nlike EML Ops was like all the older age\\nuh you know before you know AI kind of\\ntook off right so everybody thought it\\nwas building a like an mlops product\\nright so everybody was very happy to\\nmeet with me and then be very\\ndisappointed that I'm building something\\ncalled the vector database what is that\\nlike it sounds like saying right and\\nthen with open AI just kind of\\nelevating uh the discussion to the\\nbroader audience like the technology\\nreally hasn't changed significantly to\\nbe honest I mean the the the for\\npractitioners like nothing very deep has\\nchanged except for the fact that now\\nthere was a lot of oomph behind it a lot\\nof capital and a lot of energy behind it\\nso it started started being accessed by\\nthe non AI engineer when that started\\nhappening we started ramping up so\\nquickly that we started really\\nexhausting whole all kinds of machines\\nin in gcp and AWS clouds we started like\\nreally spending millions of dollars a\\nmonth on our free tier it was complete\\nInsanity it was uh the entire team was\\ndedicated just like spinning up more and\\nmore environments and just being able to\\nkeep up with the demand I think at our\\nPeak we started having 10,000 signups\\nevery day uh which really pushed us to\\nreally think about scale and effic iy in\\na completely different way like we we\\nkind of we had to go back to the drawing\\nboard and redesign the entire solution\\nwhich later yielded the solution we have\\nin place called now called serverless\\nwhich is like maybe two orders of Mag\\nmore efficient but it kind of came out\\nof just necessity we just couldn't we\\nliterally couldn't handle the\\nload uh the funny thing is if you want\\nto talk about Investors right I did have\\nquite a few different investors write to\\nme after like that like vector that\\nbasis have become like the like a true\\ncategory in some sense we've already\\ntaken the lead and they say they went\\nwhen they when they wrote to me and said\\nhey you know I actually looked back at\\nthe notes that I took like three years\\nago and you actually said you were going\\nto build\\nthis and I like yeah uh because that\\nthat's what I was going to build and\\nthey're like okay like we just that just\\nnot very common that somebody says\\nthey're going to build something and\\nthey actually build it and that's\\nactually succeeds like that's just not\\nvery common I'm like so funny I guess\\nthey they'd all thought it was uh in\\nmlops platform but then they they read\\nthey read back through their notes and\\nthey they realized what it was what it\\nwas all along exactly was there like a\\nparticular moment that you can remember\\nthat like spiked usage you know early on\\nwas it like immediately apparent to\\nfolks as they were playing around with\\ngpt3 that they needed the vector\\ndatabase or was there like a tweet or\\nsomething something or uh in the early\\ndays of that usage spiking I think one\\nof one of the kind of moments that\\nreally just completely blew up there was\\nthis\\nuh\\nuh uh there was this open source like\\ngadget called a auto GPT that was this\\nsort of\\nlike super like minimalistic but sort of\\nlike precursor to something we would\\ncall an agent now and it was sort of\\nlike\\na a piece of nothing it was really just\\nlike\\na uh what I think even one python file\\nor just a handful of python files with\\nsome like spit and gum and you know\\nwhatever but it it like like agents do\\nit started like doing something\\npotentially interesting it was open\\nsource and so on that thing just took\\noff like\\ncrazy and you know\\nsuddenly the people's assorted\\nonboarding pine cone were not systems\\nengineer building AI platforms and rag\\napplications and and so on they were\\nlike the dentist that remembers python\\nfrom college and wants to play with AI\\nright and then like things just\\ncompletely went insane like because\\nthere's way more\\ndentists I guess a lot of dentists that\\nuh that remember their luckily enough\\nthat kind of like normalized again and\\nthe people who come today oh mostly\\nBuilders but for a while there it just\\ncompletely went insane yeah it seems\\nlike there's a a huge breadth of\\napplications that are built on top of of\\npine cone what are some of your favorite\\napplications or or some of the ones that\\nthat really stand out to you obviously\\nwe're talking about notion before and um\\nand it sounds like pine cone really\\nshines for scale as well when people\\nhave kind of millions of vectors that um\\nthat they want to to run workloads on\\ntop of so Millions is actually the small\\nscale today when we speak with customers\\nand they have millions of vectos we say\\ngreat\\nuh you KN knock yourself out you'll be\\nhard pressed to spend more than 100\\nbucks a month uh like you really are\\ngoing to have to exert energy to try to\\ndo that right where we truly shine is at\\nthe hundreds of millions the billions\\nscale where companies themselves are are\\nsass uh in and often times like software\\nproviders notion is a great example gong\\nis a great example many others that\\nactually they themselves develop AI Q&A\\nsemantic search like deep AI solutions\\nfor their own customers data so they\\nlike each one of their own customers\\nmight have a million documents right but\\nthey themselves and have 10,000\\ncustomers and suddenly they find\\nthemselves needing a vabase that can\\nhandle 10 billion ineds maybe across a\\nthousand partitions\\nor 10,000 partitions and do that\\nincredibly cost effectively right and\\nwhen you try to do that especially\\nnowadays where people really start\\nunderstanding hey I'm not just playing\\nin the lab I'm building a tree a true\\nproduct so I really need to care about\\nunit economics they want to figure out\\nwhat's like what's that going to cost me\\nand then we can come in and say hey\\nbecause of our new architecture because\\nwe went through this insane spike a year\\nand a half ago and we've re architected\\neverything and now we've launched it as\\nserverless we can run this multi-tenant\\nworkload such that one of you your cost\\nfor one of your paying customers on Pine\\nCone might be a dollar a year like like\\nsometimes 50 cents a year right for a\\npaying user right and then the unit\\neconomics really shine right so you you\\nsaid you know if you have a million you\\nknow vector right I mean a a million\\nvectors like okay if you have a million\\nvectors 10,000 times you really don't\\nwant that to be 100 bucks each you\\nreally want each one of them to be 50\\ncents each and then that starts making\\nsense right uh and that's where we truly\\nshine because then you really can can\\noperate this thing at scale on the\\napplication side are most people running\\nrag or doing semantic search or um I\\nguess what types of applications do you\\nsee I can imagine you know the Q&A at\\nnotion that's kind of one and then I can\\nimagine there's tons that gong is doing\\nas well with with vectors and turning\\nvideos into vectors yeah Q&A and\\nsemantic search are very large\\napplications very well understood chat\\nBots support Bots uh which are sort of\\nlike Q&A if you will uh but in special\\nflavor of that uh people do uh legal\\nDiscovery U medical history Discovery\\nand all sorts of you know analytics on\\nthat\\nuh which again you can think about them\\nas flavors of search in in some sense\\nright there's a lot more that has to do\\nwith images and audio and video and\\nanomaly detection and security which is\\nstarting to become like a big thing\\nPharma and Drug Discovery are you know\\nwe see some applications like that but\\nthe kind of meat and potato is really\\njust the kind of text and and images and\\nsearch and uh you know rag over that in\\nsome sense and by the way rag in and of\\nitself is sort of like like you know\\nbased on semantic search it's it's like\\nthe the kind of the magic sauce happens\\nat the ma at the semantic search layer\\nnot at the reformulation the year that\\nmakes a lot of sense and and and I guess\\nobviously you know I think in the\\nbeginning folks have used you know\\nembeddings for it feels like mostly Text\\ndata and there's been you know some in\\nthe image world but I'm wondering you\\nknow we've had different perspectives on\\non this podcast about you know how much\\nmultimodal stuff we'll see this year and\\nwhether you know I'm curious you\\nobviously have a firsthand view to it uh\\nyou know are you seeing lots of folks uh\\nworking with image and video data and\\nand do you think that we have the\\nunderlying tools required to for those\\nuse cases today or or you still expected\\nto be a text dominant 2024 so look I\\nmean I am unfortunately I've been in AI\\nor machine learning before that or Big\\nData before that or all that you know\\nfor 20 years now and\\nso\\nuh uh I think I have a good mix of uh\\nenthusiasm about the the the promise of\\ntomorrow and a healthy focus on the\\nproblems of yesterday right uh even\\ntoday right with the advance\\nof foundational models and you know\\nGeneral Ai and all that\\nstuff the average Company still finds it\\nhard to even like train any deep\\nlearning model at all yeah like anything\\nlike a million parameter not a billion\\nnot 10 billion not General AI nothing\\nlike any model same goes to search and\\nand so on so you know I think we need to\\nbe\\nvery\\nuh kind of realistic about what is\\npossible right by the Trailblazers the\\nresearch labs and the technology leaders\\nand what is an actual technology that\\ncompanies actually use right and those\\ncould be five years apart sometimes\\nright so can we already see amazing\\nthings with multimodal for sure right do\\nI think multimodal is going to head the\\nkind of mainstream technology developer\\nin the next year or two unlikely yeah I\\nmean I think it's interesting because\\nyou you are working hand inand with\\nthese companies that are uh deploying in\\nmany times their their first generative\\nAI products and so I imagine you do see\\nthese barriers or or the places where\\nfolks fall down and being able to do\\nthat like what do you feel like the\\nbiggest barriers today in terms of\\ngetting you know these training these\\nmodels and getting them into production\\nfor some of the classic use cases that\\nwe're seeing around you know support or\\nor search or others I mean one of the\\nbiggest ones is hallucinations right\\nthey're just they're not trustworthy\\nright they just\\ndon't whatever they they're compelled\\nthey're large language models they're\\ndesigned to generate language right uh\\nand when you are compelled to write a\\npage of text on something you know\\nnothing\\nabout you will write a page of text uh\\nand that will contain stuff\\nyou know Pat and I do that all the time\\nI was going to say yeah we've all been\\nin like sixth grade\\nand I remember that experience very well\\nlike cold sweat I'm like [\\xa0__\\xa0] um that's\\nthe mode we put these llms in right uh\\nand so like and then we're so sort of\\nlike surprised that what comes out is is\\nnonsense right I think that's a huge\\nproblem and I think that's something\\nthat we as a technology would have to a\\nsociety I mean not we Pine con I mean we\\nthe world have to Grapple with and\\nreally bring really good solutions to I\\nthink it will start with AI startups and\\ntechnology companies that build on Pine\\nCone build on models and so on that have\\nalready know how to work with those\\nTechnologies building great vertical\\nsolutions for support for medical\\nhistory for legal Discovery for you know\\nyou name it like that's a very long list\\nof applications right right and then I\\nthink two three years down the line you\\nwould see maturity in the broader Market\\nwhere now like every large company would\\nuse some of those tools but would also\\nuse Vector bases and models and you know\\nvisibility and like a bunch of other AI\\nspecific Technologies kind of natively\\nfor for the own development where this\\nhas\\nbecome so commonplace so well understood\\nso Ironclad and so well like ingrained\\nin the developer culture that just\\npeople whatever there's just enough\\nthere that people just know how to use\\nit well I feel like hallucinations come\\nup time and time again I guess have have\\nyou seen what what do you feel like the\\nbest way to you know for for folks\\nlistening they they're also trying to\\nfigure this out what are what are some\\nof the best things you're seeing in\\nterms of ways to get around this there\\nare a few different really important\\nefforts on this front first of all we we\\nare only now starting to truly be able\\nto even measure hallucinations\\nright to even know like you can for\\nexample you can design a model I can\\nwrite a model uh that never hallucinates\\nby just always saying I don't know\\nright right that's not hallucinating\\nright it's also completely useless but\\nit it never makes a mistake and you know\\nwhatever like it never miss steps right\\nuh okay is this worthwhile like should\\nwe should we uh celebrate that outcome I\\ndon't think so right okay so you really\\nwant to measure kind of usefulness and\\ncorrectness and faithfulness to the data\\nthat you were trained on or the data\\nthat you have in a vual database to do\\nragon and so on so the just these\\nmeasures of even what is good is is is\\nalready like a very complicated question\\nand I think that there is a uh a another\\nhuge effort that has to do with frankly\\nwith Rag and with Vector databases and\\nwith knowledge layers and capacities and\\npeople grappling with okay how do I now\\nmake my data available to the model in a\\nway that's secure that is well\\nunderstood that is data governed that\\nyou know I can maybe delete stuff that I\\nwhatever like I was gdpr told me that I\\nhave to delete and somehow I need to\\nknow for a fact it's not somehow a part\\nof model anymore and so on um there's a\\nlot of work there and that's you know a\\ntopic we actually made a lot of progress\\non already so by we again I mean not\\nonly pine cone but this like Community\\nlike starts to have pretty good\\nsolutions for super cool it seems like a\\nHacker News Post in the making an llm\\nthat will never hallucinate just respond\\nwith I don't know every single time\\nuh like creatively avoid the question\\nexactly but we know like we know I mean\\njokes aside we we already today can load\\nall of whatever like a oh but a good\\nchunk of the\\ninternet uh into pine cone as as an\\nindex and basically R run like a\\nlanguage model next to it with you know\\nnot incredibly sophisticated Rag and\\nalready outperform gp4 like today it's\\nwe've already ran experiments like this\\nso like I I think there's something\\nthere and I think we're we're going to\\nsee some significant progress there both\\non sort of like consumer facing products\\nand like B2B products vectors are the\\nlanguage of AI U or kind of what AI\\nspeaks and there's this land grab to\\nstore them everyone wants to store the\\nvectors and because of that there's kind\\nof been this explosion I mean you would\\nknow this better than than us but\\nthere's been this explosion of startups\\nuh that are going after storing vectors\\nbut then also incumbents and folks like\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] that are adding support for\\nvectors so how do you think about the\\nlandscape of you know the startups that\\nare kind of vying to to store some of\\nthese workloads and then the incumbents\\nas well don't get me started about [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nit's a company that freaking heard the\\nword AI for the first time a year ago\\nand suddenly they're like experts so I\\nmean\\ndon't whatever like storing vectors I\\nthink is exactly what's happening and I\\nthink you define it perfectly right\\npeople understand that now this is a\\ndata type right next to my sentences or\\nmy images I'm going to store a semantic\\nrepresentation of that object that came\\nout of some embedding model right and\\nthat thing is a float array right it's\\nwhatever like a thousand floats right\\nand if your infrastructure be it like a\\nnon- AI technology say that rhymes with\\nBongo uh\\nyou know you need to put that array of\\nnumbers somewhere and so they have to\\nhave that as a type really and that's\\nbasically what's happening there right\\nand so you know whatever you there's\\nsome work that has to be done to do that\\nthat doesn't make your database natively\\nbe able to query those things and work\\nwith that data type at all right what\\npeople don't understand about Vector\\nbases and why they're so unique is that\\nthat\\nthat numeric array becomes in some sense\\nthe key some conceptual way that is the\\nprimary lookup that is the way you\\norganize data on blob storage that's how\\nyou load segments that's how you you\\nknow search through the your Universe by\\nthe way that's how your own brain does\\nit right I mean this is an incredibly\\nunique and optimized stack that if you\\nyou know try to somehow bolt on this\\nlike data type and like pretend that\\nit's now a vector database you're going\\nto get incredibly poor performance and\\nand flank run into like serious issues\\nnow I mean I think it's it's really\\ninteresting because um you know I feel\\nlike obviously yeah a lot of a lot of\\nother folks have um have come into the\\nspace and I think generally there's been\\nthis question of like you know what's\\nthe what's the rag stack end up being\\nand I feel like you guys get thrown\\naround all the time as as a key part of\\nthat and I'm wondering like if you uh\\nyou know if you had to go to a company\\ntoday uh and build a rag product like\\nwhat would be your stack besides pine\\ncone of course that's interesting I I I\\nfrankly I think a lot of people default\\nto open\\na uh I I wouldn't we actually see really\\ngood performance out of smaller\\ncheaper uh somehow easier to manage\\nsometime open source models the there is\\nno reason to spend a ton of money on\\nthat there\\nis sort of like like an ml etling part\\nof it has to do with bulk\\nTransformations and movement of data and\\nso on we've really started enjoying any\\nscales product and we really like start\\npartnering with them closer and we're\\nreally enjoying their\\nstack uh we work with h forel and others\\non kind of uh launching applications and\\nand you know building the the you know\\nkind of app\\nlayer uh you know we partner pretty\\nclosely with coher and AI 21 and and uh\\nyou know we're put you know others like\\nhugging face and others like we're all\\nwhatever they're all in the mix we see I\\nthink a good combination of of those\\nmodels both for embedding and for uh\\nranking and summarization and so on I\\nreally don't have a good vendor for or a\\ngood technology for evaluation yet that\\nI'm you know I'm going to some people\\npeople are going to write back to me\\nthat they're angry that I didn't name\\nthem but uh I think\\nthat uh uh that'd be very interesting to\\nfor a a leader to emerge in in that\\nstack I think it's it's it's very\\ninteresting and it's very hard to do\\nright and and then as you think about\\nkind of like Pine cone's footprint I\\nmean obviously I imagine a key part of\\nof getting pine cone to work in an\\nEnterprise just having the data ready to\\nto be put into a vector database right\\nand I imagine there's all sorts of you\\nknow we've obviously met companies that\\nare that are focused on that and then\\nthere's you know the metadata you apply\\nto it obviously then the retrieval\\nmethods you use to to uh to uh take it\\nfrom a vector database like how do you\\nthink about ultimately like the\\nfootprint you want to have versus you're\\nlike I would love I would love there to\\nbe a best-in-class vendor that's that's\\ngreat at the ETL side and and never have\\nto touch that yeah so um you're right I\\nmean I and by why I apologize to the the\\nthe audience I'm like a I'm like a\\ninfrastructure guy so I I kind of look\\nat the raw machines and like very basic\\ninfrastructure a lot of\\ncompanies that uh are stepping into the\\nembedding generation and data generation\\ninto V datab bases that're actually\\ndoing really well right uh unstructured\\nuh comes to mind but that is becomes a\\nviable option like very soon and for\\nespecially for specific channels right\\nso if you have a a fixed\\nso if you have a common data Channel say\\nyou import your data say with five Tran\\nfrom Snowflake and now you have that\\ndata in a in a table that has a\\nunified structure because whatever\\nbecause it's the same table that every\\nfive Trend customer would have then\\nthere are companies who would take that\\nand and transform it and fit it into a\\nvector base so you can rag over your you\\nknow say you know Salesforce you know\\nnotes on customers and so on right uh\\nand so if people if you understand that\\nthe data source that you have is like\\nstandard then it's very likely you will\\nfind somebody who will have already buil\\nthat pipeline be very happy to sell it\\nto you and you were talking about how uh\\nhow effective some of the smaller models\\ncan be relative to an open AI yeah how\\nmuch intelligence do you think will\\nhappen at the vector DB retrieval step\\nversus at the generation step it sounds\\nlike you know maybe over time people are\\nyou know they want to run on on their\\nown data and and um you know maybe you\\nguys are seeing good results with with\\nthat as well like I'll give an economics\\nanswer to this right the Market's going\\nto have to find like the stable point\\nwhere there's a good tradeoff\\nbetween cost compute and infrastructure\\nthat you're willing to run and the\\nquality of the output right we're\\nalready at the point where making models\\nbigger on gpus is not reasonable you can\\nrun an experiment you know you can flex\\nand say I have you know whatever 100\\nbillion parameter model and it's\\nwhatever it's like does XYZ but whatever\\nyou're not going to run a 100 billion\\nparameter model for every API call on\\nyour platform that's you're going to\\njust it's just you're going to go\\nbankrupt right and you're going to make\\nthe planet hotter so like that that's\\nnot going to work long term and so\\npeople really have to find better\\nSolutions right again what we see is\\nthat with those model\\nmodels uh if you do things right\\nsometimes the the results could even get\\nbetter and if they're even if they're\\nnot better they're not noticeably worse\\nand you might be operating on like you\\nknow cents on the dollar uh in terms of\\noperating costs right so yeah um I have\\nno doubt that we would move there that\\ndoesn't mean the arms raised to whatever\\nlike bigger better models not going to\\nexist I just don't think that's what the\\nMarket's G to operate with the kind of\\nthe most of the Market's going to\\noperate with it is interesting it feels\\nlike as these context windows were\\ngetting longer you know these last few\\nmonths people were like oh well you know\\nis is there a future for rag you just\\nstuff you know everything you'd want and\\nin impr prompt but I mean I'm curious\\nyour thoughts on that it seems like from\\na cost perspective obviously uh that\\nthat you know if you're charging per\\ntoken that that can get pricey quickly\\nyeah I mean I I think the fact that\\nmodel companies allow you to bring in a\\nbigger and a bigger context I mean I\\nthink this is the least surprising thing\\nin the world that's their pricing model\\nright what like shockingly enough\\nthey're willing for you to pay them more\\nwhat what a what a you know what a\\nshocker there multiple problems with not\\nonly is it slow and expensive it doesn't\\nactually help more often than not right\\nand uh and finally it just runs out of\\nsteam right you can say Hey you know\\nwhatever like write me a job description\\nand here is an example job description\\nto go off of great that's great for a\\ncontext window right if like here like\\n10 job descriptions to go off of okay\\nthat also works he a million job\\ndescriptions to go off of like okay\\nthat's not going to work right or\\nwhatever like write something and then\\nget information from the web or get\\ninformation from all of my documentation\\never right uh that just doesn't work I\\nmean just think about that like sending\\nall your company data to open\\nAI on every query like that clearly is\\nnot the right thing\\ntotally I mean it makes it makes all the\\nmore sense as you focus on these perfect\\nuses for pinec con that are hundreds of\\nmillions of vectors it's like those are\\nexactly the ones that you know would\\nwould never make any sense to stuff in a\\ncontext window yeah but but even even\\neven at the small scale I again I'm you\\nknow I want to paint the extreme because\\nlike that's where it becomes like almost\\nlike faral like obviously impossible\\nright but even when you can create like\\na whatever put a 100,000 tokens in a in\\nin a context\\nwindow I mean putting those documents in\\na vector database you might be able to\\nsend instead of 100,000 you''ll be able\\nto send\\n10,000 and that' be just as good if not\\nbetter whatever 3,000 and you'd be\\npaying whatever like 10% and not lose\\nany performance so why not right and so\\nagain even small cases where the context\\nengine is theoretically workable even\\nthen it's very rarely that right the\\nbest solution in terms of cost and\\nperformance totally and I guess just\\ngenerally as you think about how folks\\nare using pine cone today does it feel\\nlike there's you know folks relatively\\nstandardized around the embeddings\\nmodels they use or retrieval methods or\\none thing I'm always curious about is\\nwhether you know uh it feels like at in\\nthe limit there will be you know\\ndifferent retrieval methods for\\ndifferent use cases and different\\nembedding models that are particularly\\ngood for you know uh different\\nIndustries and uh it's hard to tell from\\nthe outside how much of that is\\nhappening today versus like hey let's\\njust try and get this thing to work you\\nknow know and and use uh but I'm curious\\nwhat you're seeing frankly most\\ncompanies are trying to get this to work\\nright very few companies have done it\\nlong enough and have like really gotten\\nthe experience with it that they really\\nstart to now iterate over the embedding\\nmodels and the retrieval and the\\nreranking and the filtering and like\\nreally get very deep in the application\\nstack and and figure out how to build\\nthis and uh I think we're getting there\\nit's a part of the maturity in the\\nmarket like and the same way that any\\nsearch recommendation stack is it's not\\njust the retrieval there's like a lot\\nthat goes before it and a lot that goes\\nafter it uh to really get the results\\nthat you need and this is one of the\\nmain discussions that I have with larger\\ncompanies that I work with that you know\\nI tell them hey you know this is going\\nto be able to do amazing things but it's\\nnot Magic I mean it's not you're not\\ngoing to just hook it up and\\neverything's going to be perfect this is\\nyou know this is work you know we're\\ngoing to have scientists and Engineers\\nwork on this thing for multiple quarters\\nand we're going to learn and iterate and\\nimprove and add stuff and remove stuff\\nand we'll get there eventually we'll be\\nable to do Q&A incredibly well and you\\nknow chat support and legal Discovery\\nand all that stuff it is possible\\nbecause we've been building these things\\nfor years now and we know it's possible\\nwe also know it's\\nnot trivial like and every use case is\\nslightly different and every application\\nhas different preferences and different\\nComfort zones on the ratio between speed\\nand cost and accuracy and and format and\\nlength of the input and the output and\\nlike freshness of the data and like you\\nyou name it there you just really have\\nto build up a whole solution around it\\nand that takes time and I imagine you\\nknow one thing that must be interesting\\nfor you as a business is and I've heard\\nthis from other folks that selli tools\\nand Enterprises is you kind of land in\\nand I'm sure they're like oh this is\\namazing we have you know EO and this\\nawesome pine cone team like build out\\nour Q&A you know product for us or\\nsomething and and you know they're so\\nexcited to have you there and obviously\\nyou know I think at at scale you you you\\ncertainly want to be empowering the\\ndevelopers in these companies to you\\nknow uh to to build these things and to\\ntweak things themselves like how have\\nyou thought about you know where you're\\njust hey it's the early days of the\\nspace like we might as well just come in\\nand help them tune the knobs and and\\nmake this implementation work uh versus\\nyou know hey we really want to um we're\\nkind of about to be a little more\\nreligious about them just you know being\\nplaying around with with the different\\nthings Pine has to offer so for uh the\\nfirst three years of the company's\\nexistence uh my uh board was uh very\\nunhappy with me because we were almost\\nreligiously not doing that like we would\\nget questions and we would whatever\\neverything that we\\nstood was needed we either documented\\nvery clearly that we don't do or we made\\nit very very easy or maybe completely\\ntransparent uh and pine con just\\ncompletely something you don't have to\\ndo at all or something that we don't do\\nat all like either we take care of it\\n100% or we do zero% of it right and then\\nwe were very explicit about that right\\nwe had to often times have very\\nuncomfortable conversations with\\npotentially large customers that need\\nhelp with XYZ and we know how to do XYZ\\nand we tell them no we can't help you\\nbecause we're really busy building a\\nVictor database but that\\nreally panned out in the growth phase of\\nthe company where you you really started\\nhaving literally thousands of customers\\nwho not only don't like seek our help\\nthey're not willing to meet with\\nus they're like they're just happy and\\nsuccessful and they don't want to waste\\ntheir time it's like hey this [\\xa0__\\xa0] works\\nI don't I have better things to do I\\ndon't need to talk to you guys I'm like\\nokay and so my sales team is agonizing\\nabout like hey like this is whatever we\\nneed to speak with them we don't know\\nwho they are I'm like I don't know but\\nthey don't want to talk to us what do\\nyou want to do for the folks that like\\nyou know maybe are not talking to you\\nand and can't get it to work like is\\nthere one like thing you wish that\\npeople tried more like oh if only you\\nwould like use a different embeddings\\nmodel or I don't know whatever it is\\nlike is there one kind of common failure\\nmode you see for people are that are\\ntrying this and can't get it to work\\nyeah\\nso I will say that as a company also\\nwe've we've grown and evolved then\\ncompanies that do want to help do want\\nour help we engage with them we we're\\nnot like a Professional Services team\\nright we won't go and build a whole\\nsolution but we're very very happy to\\nhelp and and uh consult people on their\\njourney and we've started doing that a\\nlot more now that we have more capacity\\nobviously in a team um\\num I think what people really get wrong\\nis is cost estimations right I mean this\\nis one of those things that just you\\nknow people come to me and like oh we\\ndid the napkin math and like we would\\npay you know $50,000 a month to Pine\\nCone and that doesn't make sense to us\\nI'm like how did you compute that and\\nthen they would tell you and you're like\\noh my God like you know you just kind of\\nlike just walk them through the the cost\\ncalculators like 500 bucks a month I'm\\nlike oh okay like great I'm really I'm\\nI'm really happy we had this\\nconversation right so yeah designing\\ntheir AI\\nsolution even if it's it could like seem\\nlike a small change but that might make\\na huge difference in the cost of the\\ninfrastructure and latencies and\\nfreshness and a bunch of other stuff so\\nwe're very happy to help with that\\npeople get that wrong on a regular basis\\nand for me again as a technologist if\\nyou use the wrong embedding models sure\\nyour results might be slightly worse\\nslightly better you can fix that if you\\ncalculated the costs and you now don't\\nembark on the journey because you\\nfigured it was going to be too expensive\\nand that calculation was wrong you've\\njust like you're not even building\\nsomething that you should be\\nbuilding uh and that for me is a is a\\nkind of sort of more final failure mode\\nwhich is much more painful and frankly\\nannoying because I you know I hear about\\nsome of those things in hindsight well\\nsome really large customer would say oh\\nwe thought about you guys but then uh\\nlike we figured we can't run this\\nproject and then you're like W uh on the\\ncost side one thing that we see across a\\nlot of our infrastructure companies is\\nthey ship an improvement that makes the\\ndatabase or whatever it is is much more\\nefficient and then people actually end\\nup storing less or there's less compute\\num or it cost customers less my guess is\\nwith the serverless announcement that\\ncustomers could potentially be paying\\nyou less than they otherwise would have\\nbecause you know they're now it's a\\ntotally serverless model like was that\\nsomething uh what was it like shipping\\nthat change and um you know ultimately\\num the best thing for your customers but\\nuh potentially at the expense of some\\nshort-term Revenue like how did how did\\nyou think about um kind of moving to the\\nthe serverless model no it's it's very\\npainful for us as a company and like for\\nFounders listening this is it's it's a\\nhard transition and you know for\\ninvestors to see your Revenue kind of go\\nup into the right in exactly the right\\nexponent and suddenly that thing\\nstarting to flatten out and you tell\\nthem hey look at workloads actually grow\\nfaster now right but revenue is impacted\\nby the fact that our product is so much\\ncheaper now right um that is a\\ncomplicated discussion and that like you\\nknow investors don't necessarily love to\\nsee that and even though they sort of\\nlike uh they understand it uh uh of\\ncourse they can rationalize it but they\\nstill emotionally react badly to\\nit right uh my advice to Founders\\nis that kind of transition is much\\neasier done earlier than later uh and so\\nyou should really move and do that as\\nfast as you can and take the hit as soon\\nas possible right um you know uh for\\nus we think we're leaving on the table\\nmore than half of our revenue for some\\nof the customers is going to be uh 70 80\\n90% uh reduction in cost for extreme\\ncases in Pharma and others where the\\nworkload is like super super super uh\\nlike storage heavy this could be as as\\nlittle L one or two% of the spend like\\nwe have companies they used to pay us\\n100K they now pay us $2,000 a month a\\nyear sorry it's like literally almost\\nnothing right uh so they're very happy I\\nmean un investors are not very happy\\nabout that but uh at the end of the day\\nit's\\nuh it's it's it's the right thing for\\nthe customer and it's the right thing\\nfor people\\nBuilding Solutions on top of our\\nplatform and so if we can fit\\nreally nicely into their own cost\\nstructure of their own products we're\\nnot going to be a part of the stack\\nright and you know when I think about\\nthe trajectory of the\\nAI\\nstack we're really in the very first of\\nthat like every\\nsign shows that the adoption curve is\\nsuch that like we're very early adopters\\nyou know um you know\\nTrailblazers just getting to production\\nand so on at the end of the day like\\nalmost every company is going to have a\\nvector base doing something either small\\nor medium or\\nlarge uh we're not there yet and so you\\nknow if that's where we aim if we need\\nto fit snuggly into that cost structure\\nfor like tens of thousands of or\\nhundreds of thousands of different\\nworkloads we just have to do that even\\nyou you know that there a lot of you\\nknow pain uh in the medium term well\\nyeah one thing you know I I was struck\\nby as he he were kind of talking about\\nhow we're in the early days of you know\\nAI infrastructure um you know a question\\nthat every investor always and and folks\\nin the ecosystem are always asking is\\nwhat are kind of net new categories for\\nstartups versus you know natural places\\nfor comments to build product obviously\\nit seems like Factor databases have been\\none of the space where there's been a\\nlot of net new companies you know\\nyourselves at the Forefront as you look\\nat the other parts of AI infrastructure\\nlike what parts do you think make sense\\nfor new players what parts are like the\\nexisting infrastructure players going to\\nprovide well uh Curious how you think\\nabout that you know frankly I much more\\nexcited about the application and the\\nthe the solution space more than\\nthe uh infrastructure layer right I mean\\nfor new companies right this is uh\\num in infrastructure there's a win or\\ntake all\\nuh\\nuh you know\\nphenomenon that clearly works great for\\nus but but that also just means that the\\nyou know the the uh where just the space\\nfor for new companies is is very limited\\nright on the solution and application\\nside I think there is so much energy and\\nso much excitement and so many\\ndifferent uh problems that can be solved\\nin Creative new ways\\nnow that uh I frankly think\\nevery you know every digital native\\nhas uh whatever like 20 different\\nstartups that like say now oh like we\\nare the new blah with AI right and uh\\nnow they you know so you have 20\\nstartups trying to uh usurp uh some some\\nsome long-term player and you have that\\nlong-term player trying to reassert\\nthemselves as an AI uh Native\\nsolution uh and at the same time you\\nhave Enterprises both buying those\\nTechnologies and learning how to use\\nthem uh and so this it becomes like this\\nconveyor belt of innovation from Tiny\\nstartups all the way down up to\\nEnterprises uh that is just teaming with\\nwith Innovation and and great ideas and\\na ton of value so I I you know again I\\nliterally see hundreds of customers\\nhundreds of like\\ncompanies a week that that work with us\\nand so on and like each and every one of\\nthem does something unique and\\ninteresting and you're like holy [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nthere's yet another application wow\\nthere's more Val this I didn't think\\nabout this okay amazing that's I guess\\nso wow what a fun kit right I mean I I\\nknow you're an infrastructure guy but if\\nyou uh if if you couldn't do ponco and\\nand had and were instead building an AI\\napplication what would you build it's G\\nto sound uh weird to you but I I just\\nreally love uh communication like like\\nuh email and slack and Twitter and like\\nI just love that kind of\\ndata you know meetings re like\\ntranscriptions and like conversations\\nand uh so there's something about human\\ncommunication written or spoken that\\nis uh I feel like just fascinating and\\nand and there's like a ton of knowledge\\nto be extracted it's all like super\\nMissy and exciting and complicated and\\nand very rich\\nand you know it will be something like\\nthat whether it's medical records or\\nemails or jira tickets or what have you\\nlike it would be something like that I\\nthought you were going to say something\\naround surfing but uh Communications\\nmake sense too I wish I wish there was\\nlike some yeah this I thought we were\\nlimiting the scope to Ser to uh tech\\ncompanies if it was probably harder to\\nbuild a really strong software business\\nin\\nsurfing I was like Wonder I was imag\\nlike embeding surfing videos or\\nsomething you know for technique\\ncoaching yeah could have a tech company\\nwhere I uh surf every day and then\\npretend to have worked\\nuh on something techology there's\\nactually just an AI That's running the\\nwhole time you're surfing there's an\\nagent that's doing all the work exactly\\nthis is like my software company in the\\nMal Dives on yeah I'm I'm honestly\\nconvinced with some of Pat's\\nhallucinations that's what's happening\\non uh on his end\\nI I guess you know also I mean you\\nobviously were were're previous lit to\\nyou know interesting places I mean\\ncurious like your reflection on on maybe\\nwe'll go back to the most recent one in\\nAmazon like how do you kind of think\\nthey're positioned right now what would\\nyou be building if you were still there\\nuh obviously you did a lot of the\\nsagemaker work um any any Reflections on\\nthat sure I you know I I look I mean\\ndifferent companies just need to what\\nhave the benefits and also like the\\nrestriction of needing to focus on\\ndifferent parts of the stack right uh\\nwhen you run at AWS scale if your\\nproduct doesn't bring in hundreds of\\nmillions of dollars a year uh it's a\\nfailed product it doesn't actually move\\nthe needle at all right startups operate\\nin a different mode and so on and you\\nknow your horizon for Innovation and\\nyour appetite for risk is different and\\nso on so you know I don't know that\\nAmazon Frank L Google or Microsoft are\\neven working on the things that you know\\nwe're working on uh I can tell you that\\nwe are laser focused on stuff that we\\nknow for a fact is going to be a part of\\nthe stack and a part of the\\nsolution uh and is realistically going\\nto hit the market in at least you know a\\nyear and a half or two from now because\\nit's that early right in the same way\\nthat you know five years ago we people\\nknow didn't know what the hell we were\\nsaying when we said Victor dat bases you\\nknow we are now already working on the\\nstuff that's going to hit the market in\\ntwo or three years from now so that\\nthat's that's that's the most exciting\\nthing for me to be honest I me this is\\nwhere like the really cool stuff is uh\\nkind of happens behind the scenes yeah\\none thing that I think is interesting\\nespecially around you know how company\\nhow far in advance companies and\\ninfrastructure companies like you guys\\nneed to plan is you know being able to\\nskate to where the puck Puck is going\\nand you know kind of predict the future\\nin in some extent especially in a market\\nthat is moving so fast where\\ninfrastructure is changing really really\\nquickly and context windows are changing\\nwhat the models can do are changing Are\\nthere specific kind of Technologies or\\narchitectures or or maybe even companies\\nthat you're watching and you're like\\nokay that is going to be a really big\\nthing in one year or in two years um or\\nanything like that that's on your radar\\nI think there's going to be a\\nsignificant ific an shift in the kinds\\nof Hardware that we use right what is\\nhappening now with gpus I think\\nis not sustainable and it might still go\\nup before it goes down but I don't think\\nthis\\nis uh what AI will look like going\\nforward right so that's that's on on\\nHardware we're going to have to see some\\nsomething change there um and do you\\nthink that means more CPU workloads or\\npeople adapting models to run on CPUs or\\nor maybe it's something else it's um\\nit's going to be CPUs and gpus and maybe\\nspecialized uh you know spec servers\\nthat are really optimize for either\\ntraining or surveying or maybe\\ndistributed infrastructure for that you\\nknow I'm I'm sure Vector that Bas is are\\ngoing to pay a play a part in that but\\nit's it's not it's not even I'm not even\\nsuggesting that right now it's really\\njust there has to be a change just like\\nmicroeconomic just doesn't make sense\\nwhat's happening now in terms of data\\npipelines and and kind of data\\nmanagement and and so on again\\nsomething's going to have to change it's\\nit's the tools that we\\nhad 5 10 years ago just don't cut it\\nanymore uh and both the operational\\nheadache and the actual costs and the\\ntime they have to wait and so on are\\njust not reasonable something's going to\\nhave to change there\\num and again finally I I think we're\\ngoing to have to start seeing those\\nmoderating systems where they even if\\nyou don't own the model or whatever like\\nyou have to somehow be able to have some\\nkind of governance and and visibility\\nand ability to control what's happening\\nwith your stack that today runs open\\nloop for for most companies so we're\\ngoing to see I think meaningful changes\\nin the stack and in the in the software\\nwe use for it I'm too intrigued by what\\nyou said earlier about things you're\\nworking on that you know will will blow\\nour minds in two three years all right I\\ndon't know if we're allowed to ask but\\nI'll ask anyway any hints you can give\\nus on some of the research directions or\\nor where things are going in in your\\nworld I\\nwish I had to I had to shamelessly uh\\nyou know give it a go we'll we'll we'll\\nhave to just reschedule you for 18\\nmonths from now so you can uh you can\\nannounce it with us I promise I promise\\nuh to share we can be the VCS that uh\\nthat then are saying wow you actually\\nsaid you actually did exactly what\\ndo exactly um well you know we always\\nlike to end our conversations with a\\nquick fire around where we get your\\nthoughts on on a set of common questions\\nwe ask folks and so maybe to kick it off\\nwould love your thoughts on one thing\\nthat's overhyped and one thing that's\\nunderhyped uh in AI today it's going to\\nsound nuts but I think foundational\\nmodel models are overhyped we know\\nexactly what they can and cannot do and\\nI don't think we're actually making a\\nlot of progress there to be honest for\\nquite a long time not any qualitative\\nprogress I mean not any significant\\nprogress you know I I don't know if it's\\nunderhyped but I find the code\\ngeneration and and coding assistance to\\nbe exceedingly useful it's one of\\nprobably the most uh exciting use cases\\nof this technology so underhyped what's\\nbeen the biggest surprise in building\\npine cone maybe something that you\\nthought would work but didn't or\\nsomething that you didn't think was\\ngoing to work that that ended up working\\nreally well we had a at some point\\npretty early I mean not very early on\\nmaybe a year and a half into the\\ncompany maybe two I might be off but\\nwhat up a year and a half or two into\\nthe life of the company we had a\\ncomplete rewrite of the entire database\\nin Rust everything from like we had C\\nand python go and control plan and this\\nthat like a million different things and\\nwe just we just rewrote everything in\\nRust uh because we\\nfigured like the kind of operational\\nissues that we were running into were\\nnot going to be we're not going to be\\nable to scale with them I thought that\\nwas like borderline suicide and it would\\ntake us six months to even like get to\\nthe point where we can\\neven you know be on par with our\\nexisting system and at that point we'll\\nbe far behind then our CTO Ram Shara was\\nyou know I'm going to we're going to\\nwe're going to complete this turn around\\nin like a month we're like no\\nway and uh I was shocked it didn't take\\na month it took it took you know two\\nthree months but you know the result was\\nso much better than than what we had\\nbefore that again like rewrites I don't\\nknow if like anybody here whatever\\nrewrites are always like uh\\nlike whatever this is like companies\\nliterally die because of rewrites this\\nwas like a huge bit uh and oftentimes\\nthey just give you fresh and exciting\\nnew problems often times worse than the\\nones you started with this was one of\\nthose like as advertised freites it\\nactually did what we were supposed to do\\nand I was just like holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] it\\nactually\\nworked that's awesome um I guess besides\\npine cone what other company do you\\nthink would be most interesting to build\\nuh AI features at right now I would\\nprobably go build like uh whatever join\\neither research lab or high performance\\noptimization like company that really\\ndoes sort of like uh compiling for for\\nthese models I think the the fact that\\nthe execution layer and the\\ntraining the software for training and\\nexecution is one and the same is sort of\\nlike\\ninsane um so I think there's there's a\\nlot of fun engineering and science\\nproblems to be solved there when do you\\nthink we'll have agents that really work\\ndon't they work already I mean to the\\npoint where I can say hey AI agent book\\nme a trip or U something like that it I\\ndon't know it seems like they sometimes\\nwork but sometimes not so much well I\\nhave human assistants that they they\\ndon't work all the time either yeah I'm\\nnot I'm not sure where you set the bar\\non on how often they need to work as\\nmuch as like we expect from humans to\\nwork they're already doing a decent job\\nI mean is it kind of I I will say that\\nwhen they make a mistake it's more\\nembarrassing like it's more like it's\\nit's silly because it's not a mistake a\\nhuman would make uh but I think just\\nlike probability of completing the task\\nI think we're getting close to human\\nlevels awesome well I feel like there's\\na ton of threads in this conversation\\nthat folks will want to turn on it's\\nbeen a fascinating discussion I'll leave\\nthe word to you like where can folks go\\nto learn more about you about pine cone\\nuh feel free to to point folks in any\\ndirection you want um look our website\\nis always a good place to start uh\\nthere's plenty of material on how to\\nbuild stuff examples docks notebooks\\nlike uh you know reference architectures\\nIntegrations with partners and so on\\nyeah I mean it's always a good place to\\nstart I I I will you know as as a meta\\nrecommendation I would say don't don't\\ntry to learn about pine cone try to go\\nbuild something exciting and if that\\nleads you to needing pine cone great and\\nif it doesn't great you still have you\\nknow build something else that was\\nexciting nonetheless right but I think\\nlike going back to the kind of somewhere\\nin the middle of our conversation the\\nmost common mode of failure is doing\\nnothing uh and and you know if if you\\ncan overcome that you've already like\\noutdone most most of the field right\\nthen you just have to make sure you\\ndon't do the cost estimate incorrectly\\nright yes correctly and then if you\\nthink you're going to pay Pine on too\\nmuch uh drop us a line and we'll come\\ntalk to\\nyou amazing well you know this has been\\na ton of fun seriously thank you so much\\nfor coming on my pleasure\\nguys well Pat that was a that was a fun\\none yeah super fun he's he's a really\\ninteresting guest very thoughtful and\\nyou know he kind of has this lens at the\\ninfrastructure level but then they see\\nso much by virtue of everyone building\\non top of pine cone so it was uh it was\\ncool to to hear his perspective yeah I\\nme what an interesting seat I feel like\\nhe really does see everything right he\\nsees like the developers messing around\\nwith new applications he sees the really\\nsophisticated Enterprises and what's\\nrequired for them to get rag live uh I\\nfeel like it's a pretty cool uh cool\\nposition to have yeah and he's even more\\nbullish on the applications and\\ninfrastructure which I thought was funny\\nyeah I thought that was that was that\\nwas interesting um and I loved the uh\\nthe subtle JB at at VC's who you know uh\\npoo pooed vetro databases and then came\\nback in 2023 saying they had years of\\nconviction nothing nothing we would ever\\ndo obviously yeah of course not us but\\nyou know the other\\nVCS you know one thing that's just so\\ninteresting about the space as a whole\\nis I feel like we've seen folks you know\\npitching oh we have this sophisticated\\nembeddings model that works really well\\nin this context or this retrieval\\napproach and you know it's very clear\\nthat we're still in such the early\\nInnings where it's just like folks are\\njust trying to find ways to make things\\nwork the basics work and then you know\\nand I mean too's Point like you really\\nyou just got to start building right and\\nI think if you can make the basics work\\nI I do wonder when we'll move to the\\nchapter of maybe more sophisticated\\ntrade-offs and decisions around some of\\nthese uh you know embeddings models and\\napproaches to retrieval but it certainly\\nseems like you know it was interesting\\nto hear him reiterate or reaffirm that\\nuh that yeah the case today is basically\\njust can can you get something up and\\nrunning and uh he just you know it's\\nclearly he's Blown Away by the stuff\\nthat that folks have been able to get up\\nand running he's obviously biased given\\nwhere he sits as the CEO of DB company\\nbut he\\ndefinitely believes that more of the\\nintelligence will move towards the\\nretrieval and you know towards that part\\nof the stack\\nversus purely at the kind of generation\\nand Andor model stage I loved his like\\ncynicism of like what a surprise the\\npeople that charge per token have\\nincreased the context\\nwindow you know I think he's the first\\nperson we' ever had on that says\\nFoundation models were overhyped um you\\nknow I don't know if he's not a scaling\\nlaws believer or or or whatnot but it's\\nalways fun to uh to to you know to to\\nget a I mean that's I think what's so\\nfun about the space is there's just you\\nknow there's so many every time we do\\noverhype under hype there's like a\\ndifferent set of things um whereas you\\nknow uh as you know I run a healthcare\\npodcast and that space is a little bit\\nmore stagnant it's like every time the\\nsame things that are that are over and\\nunderhyped yeah I I liked his underhyped\\nanswer too of of coding assistant and\\nthere's obviously a ton of hype around\\nthem but I do think that is an\\nincredible application of AI and um uh\\nand one we're going to see a lot more of\\num Shout Out pool side I guess ex\\nexactly always got to shout out the\\nportfolio I thought it was interesting\\nwhen he was talking about people not\\ndefaulting to open AI um and you know\\nthat is kind of the default now but he\\nsees smaller models that are potentially\\ncheaper doing just as well uh I thought\\nI thought that was interesting um\\nbecause I think that's that's not really\\nsomething that we see very much where it\\nkind of most people seem to start with\\nopen AI or you know maybe draw whatever\\nand uh and then go from there totally I\\nmean I think he's laser focused on the\\neconomics of of these use cases and you\\nknow if I'm being honest I think a lot\\nof what we see today is still focus in\\nlike this exploration mode where it's\\nlike well what can you do with these\\nmodels and it's like you might as well\\nstart with open AI because if you can't\\ndo it with that you're not going to be\\nable to do it with with too much more uh\\nmaybe a smaller fune model uh but I\\nthink that you know it'll be interesting\\nto see one thing I'm super curious to\\nsee is just will folks end up in this\\nkind of optimization phase as they\\ndeploy this at SC scale probably but at\\nthe same time right when you're ready to\\noptimize GT5 comes out or the next model\\ncomes out and it's like you're you're\\nprobably right back to just exploring\\nagain like what are the capabilities\\nthat you can do with these models and so\\nI do Wonder um I'm sure we'll see plenty\\nof cost optimization but uh this\\nexploration phase I

       " Document(page_content=\"Well, no. So it was a, it was, this was considered research, not development. And so the, the, the, the way that it was, it was like an internal scientific unit at a company. And so they actually published it as a paper. I see. And, and they're actually, there's a long history of this where this is actually a lot of the great breakthroughs over time have actually come out of like industrial research labs like this. And then they, and then the company that develops, it publishes it and then they don't realize until later that they should have kept it secret. But, but also the reason that they were able to hire all these great researchers out of all these universities is they promised them that they could publish their work, right? And so sort of part of the deal with these guys was that they would get to publish. So they, they had this key breaker in 2017. So, but, but it sort of became clear in the 20 tens that like there was finally progress being made and some of these systems were gonna start to work. And Elon had some conversation with \\nLarry Page\\n who was running \\nGoogle\\n at the time. And Larry said to Elon, you know, this A I thing is really gonna work and we're gonna end up with a is that are like, you know, much, you know, smarter and more powerful than people. And Elon said, well, aren't you worried that they're gonna like, have their own goals and they're gonna take over and they're not gonna want to surround anymore. And Larry's, Larry's response was you're being species, you're being racist, but towards your species. And if they're a better form of life, then they should take over and we should all die and humanity should go away. Now knowing Larry, I think there's at least a 50% chance he was joking, but Elon couldn't tell and took him seriously. And so Elon had a visceral reaction and was like, oh my God, like the big risk here is not just developing A I, the big risk here is \\nGoogle\\n develops A I and \\nLarry Page\\n is in control of it. And he does horrible, horrible things. And so he started, he's like, oh, so he called all these people who he knew. And he said we need to start the competitive effort to that today and we need to call it, I mean, it needs to be as opposed to \\nGoogle\\n's closed A I, it needs to be open A I and, and this was to protect the world is to protect the world in Elon's views, to protect the world. So, what Elon says is we need to go hire all the best researchers we can. Speaker 3\\n02:29:34\\nIt seems to be, that's what he's always done. It's like \\nTesla\\n was, cars need to be electric. Space X\\n was, if anything happens to the earth, we could live on \\nMars\\n, he's always motivated by saving the planet. Speaker 2\\n02:29:48\\nThat's right. And, and, and, and humanity. Right. Exactly. And humanity. Yeah.\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Basically in there. And so these people in the 19 thirties knew that there was this difference. And so they said, should we model these things after a calculating machine in which they are hyper literal, like you say almost autistic, right? Which is like they're just like it was like Savant like machines where they're like really good at running large numbers of mathematical calculations very fast and then we'll give people, the ability to write programs based on that, but they're never going to be good at patterns. They're never gonna be good at language. They're never gonna be good at, they're never gonna know what anything means. You know, they, they're always going to be hard to talk to. You're never gonna be able to use natural language interface. You know, they're never gonna be able to know the difference between, you know, the, the difference between a cat and a cinnamon roll and a photo. Like they're just not gonna be good at that. So they'll be like hyper literal in that way, it's super fast but hyper literal and then humans will just still be completely different or should we try to build computers that are modeled after the human brain? And, and so it actually turns out the, the first paper on the concept of the neural network, which is the architecture of Cha A GP T it was actually written in 1943. And the A I systems we use today are still based on the ideas in that paper. So it is 80 years ago, right? So they knew enough about neuron structures and synapses in the brain that they knew. They were 43 1943. No, but, but they knew and by the way, look, the field of A I started in like 1943 like that actually fired the starting gun. And actually people have worked for the last 80 years trying to get neural networks to work and they finally just started to work. But my point is like, they, they knew from the very beginning there were these two totally different ways of making computers and they knew what the trade offs were and they just were. But it just turned out that historically, they were able to make the one kind of computer for the last 80 years. And that created the computer as we know it today. And then it turns out there's this completely other way to make a computer and that's based on the, it, it's inspired by, it's not the same as the brain, but it's inspired by the structure of the brain. And as a consequence, it's a new kind of computer and a way to think about it is, it's a computer that's actually an A I computer is actually very bad at all. The hyper literal stuff, right? And so, for example, J GP T has this thing called Hallucinates. And so if you ask it a question and it knows the answer, it gives you the answer. If it doesn't know the answer, it just makes one up. Speaker 3\\n02:18:31\\nSo it's more creative and less accurate. Exactly. Speaker 2\\n02:18:34\\nSome, somebody once said that somebody said that one of the guys who studies this says A I is not like a computer, it's like a pretty good person. It's not like the best person, but it's like a pretty good person. And what do we know about? Pretty good people? They're right. A lot of the time but a lot of the time they're not. And can you always tell the difference? Not necessarily, you know? Do they sound as confident when they're wrong as when they're right? Yeah. Do they know? No, they don't if you ask. Speaker 3\\n02:18:56\\nIt sounds like a real issue if we've spent 80 years establishing the fact that what you're getting back from a computer is more like a results from the results from a calculator. But now we're getting these fuzzy results that are more like mediocre human results, even though we've had 80 years of what we think of as accurate, that could create confusion. Speaker 2\\n02:19:23\\nSo there was a court case about three months ago where a lawyer had Chet GP T write a legal argument to be presented to a judge in a court and it did it and it hallucinated several court cases precedents that don't exist and the judge caught, it just made them up, made him up and they sound great. By the way, they sound exactly like court cases. The whole thing hangs together logically. It's just literally not true. It's mentioned cases that didn't happen. And so, and it turns out if you submit false made up court cases in court, you get disbarred as a lawyer, like you're done being a lawyer. And so the judge basically like came very close to disbarring the lawyer on the spot and the lawyer is basically a lawyer. The judge is like, did you use judge EPT to do this? And the lawyer basically fessed up and the judge basically said, if you ever do this again, I'm going to disbar you and destroy your career. But it's exactly for that reason. But however, hallucination, creativity. Speaker 3\\n02:20:09\\nBe a great scene in a movie. For example, we find in a movie. Speaker 2\\n02:20:13\\nWell, so and it actually turns out so there, there are companies now building A I for lawyers and, and actually we, we, so we did a bunch of work, we haven't invested yet, but we've done, we've done a bunch of work in this space because one of the things that A I can do is it can like write, you can write legal briefs and if it doesn't hallucinate, they're actually really good legal briefs. And so we, we've been talking to like professional lawyers about this and what the, what the professional lawyers will tell you actually is, you actually don't just want accuracy. When you're thinking about writing legal briefs, you actually do want creativity because there are different ways to make legal arguments. And maybe the way that you've thought of on your own is not the best way to do it. And maybe if you had a copilot, right? Think of you're writing a legal brief, you're a lawyer, you have a legal, you're writing a legal brief, you have a copilot. Right. And, and that copilot is just giving you ideas, right? And some of the ideas are going to be great idea. Some of the ideas are gonna be terrible ideas, but they're all new ideas, the ideas where you don't have to sit and come up with them on your own. Right? And so what the lawyers are saying basically is like in that case, you actually, you actually, you want some hallucinating, right? You, you, you don't want make up a court case that didn't happen but you want, oh, here's a different way to make the same argument, right? Or, or you might also view it as like if you're writing a closing argument to be presented to a jury like that, you know, as you know, it's like a storytelling exercise. And so you might want actually, you know, some brainstorming, you don't want the thing to do it for you because you're the guy who has to stand up there and actually present it and you have to really be willing to stand behind it, but it might be helpful to have a writing partner that can actually help you do that. And so there, there's this sort of double edged, like the fact that it Hallucinates is both a big problem, but it's also magical because we've never had computers that make things up before. Like that's a brand new thing. If you had told me three years ago, we're gonna have computers that like make up like it's never, it's never happened. There's never been a way to do that. It's the same thing and now you're seeing it, it's the way to see this really clearly. Of course, is visual design, visual art, you know, coming out of like mid journey or da or these things where it will make up all of these crazy art things and you know, look half the time it will make up like it will. And you know, there's this famous thing, they've figured it out now. But for a long time, the way that you could tell that computer art was being made by algorithm was it just, it would give extra fingers, it just turned out that the training data it was trained on. It just like it just turns out like human, human bodies relatively straightforward, except that there are these like detailed finger appendages. And if you are looking at a billion photos or pictures of people, they have fingers in all kinds of different positions. And so the early versions of the A I basically just didn't know how to do fingers accurately. They fix that now, right where it no longer does that. But by the way, if you want it to, it still will, right? And so if you tell it, render me a scene where everybody has seven fingers, it will happily do it for you. And computers never used to be able to do that, right? Or if you just want to tell it to use it, one of the things you can do, it is really fun with these things is you can do it. You can say like use your imagination or, or you can say another thing you can do is you can say, so there's this thing called prompt engineering. So it's how do you write out the prompt that tells the A I what to do, right? So which is true for both a text A I and for an image A I do the prompt. And it turns out there was a research thing done by \\nGoogle\\n a few, a few months back about what's the optimal prompt that, that optimizes the chance that there won't be hallucinations that it's gonna be the most likely to be what's called factually grounded. And it turned out the opal prompt starts with, take a deep breath really gives you the best results, right? And, and, and so, and, and, and this gets to the, the, the amazingness of what's happening.\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Speaker 2\\n48:07\\nYeah, look. So, so, and I would say \\nGoogle\\n if it was in this interesting position where number one, they invented a lot of these A I technologies, right? And so the key breakthrough for Chet GP T actually happened at \\nGoogle\\n in 2017 in classic the company form, they sat on it. They didn't, they didn't use it. If you talk to people in \\nGoogle\\n, they will tell you that \\nGoogle\\n could have had GP T chat, GP T for the way you have it today, they could have had it in 2019. Had they say, have they been focused on it?\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",

Or, you know, you could say like, I have here, I have this code that's gonna render something I need it to be faster. How should I, how should I make, how should I perform as optimize it? And a will say, well, you know, here's how you do it and here's how I, here's how I, the A I would rewrite it. And so, or you can tell the A I to like make changes, right? And so it's like, I want, you know, everything to be, I don't know, it's like you're you wanna do a translation from \\nEnglish\\n to \\nSpanish\\n and you can use the A I to like, find all the places where you have an \\nEnglish\\n language word and you can swap into the \\nSpanish\\n translation and A I could do that for you. And so it's like, it's called pilot. It's like a super, it's like a super assistant kind of thing. And so that's the, that's like a radical change. And so the, the coders that are using that versus not using that today, they're pretty much universally kind of saying that's a night and day kind of thing. And then that's just with today's A I and what everybody expects is the A is in the future are gonna get much more sophisticated. And so the, the, the sort of what the A I people basically say is in five years or 10 years, you're not even gonna have that, what you're instead gonna have is like the equivalent of like 1000 A I programmers working for you. And so you're not even gonna be writing code yourself. You're just gonna be like, basically managing the A is to write the code and, and you can basically say, you know, we would go off and do all this design and just coding and graphics and like whatever it is and you, you basically hand out assignments and then the A is go off and do it and they report back and then you kind of oversee the entire process. And so if, if that vision plays out, that's a complete revolution, right? That and that, and then the way to think about that is to think about this in terms of productivity, you know, how much software functionality can one person make in an hour or a day or a year? And what all of these changes mean is sort of an explosion of productivity. You just get to make a lot more code. Speaker 3\\n02:12:22\\nIf A I learns to code that really changes things.

Well, that's why I said, even neural networks, like, as I said, the, the, the, the first A I, I was actually shocked to learn this. I was reconstructing the history of A I last year. And I didn't even, I, I thought the debate started in the forties. It actually started in the thirties about whether you could build computers based on the human brain. So in the 19, like, how much do they know about the brain in the 19 thirties? Like, it couldn't have been that much, but they knew enough to, to, I immediately think like, wow, here's, here's what we could do. And so like, you know, like to me, like, those are the people I really to be that far ahead of your time and write. It's just like, wow, amazing. Speaker 3\\n03:10:52\\nHow would you, you know, how does Moore's Law continue to work? Speaker 2\\n03:10:58\\nSo the, you never get to the end. No, you get to the end. Well, you, you, there's huge debate around this. You, you're, you're down to what's called two nanometer transistors. And so we're, we're down to the, the level of manufacturing that's taking place. The, the incredible leaps if, if you ever get a chance, there's this company I think called Applied Materials. That's the \\nDutch\\n company that makes the equipment to manufacture modern microchips. And it's these giant rooms, it's, it's just incredibly elaborate machinery and is doing all these things a lot of us with the photolithography. So it's literally shining patterns with light to manufacture, you know, things that end up being material. And then it's these manufacturing processes, two nano two nanometers, you know, fractions of it, you know, tiny, tiny, tiny fractions of a human hair stuff as like the atomic level, like a lot of the barriers for progress. And Moore's Law literally is getting down to the level of individual atoms. And the problem is like, we can't set by the atoms without blowing everything up. It unbelievable. And so yeah, it's like manufacturing the atomic level, you know, there's huge amounts of engineering going into trying to optimize that. There's a lot of work going into trying to make like ships three dimensional right. So you, so it's not taking up another dimension, what else? There's, you know, a lot of work going into so called quantum computers, right, which is a totally different architecture design, which in theory is gonna be, you know, another one of these huge breakthroughs that just works totally differently. By the way, there's a lot of work going into biological computers. So there's people working on light storage, like turns out you can store huge amounts of data in DNA because the human body encodes enormous amounts of information that is really cool cellular level. And so there's, there's people working on that. There's people working on biological computers, you know, growing computers and tanks.

But if you, if you care about the mission of having it be open, then come and work with me and he, and he called it Open A I and he made it a nonprofit, not a for profit. And he said, you know, and then he said, basically, he said, everything we do at open A I is gonna be open sourced in the same way. Right. So he said, basically, if you come here, your work is all gonna get published, everything's gonna be open. He, he even said early on, he said, the mission of open A I is to make sure that A I is, is is it happens and is safe and is universally available all of humanity. And he said it would actually be fine if somebody else does that and makes it available. In which case open A I will just shut down and be our mission will be complete. So it was set up as nonprofit, is registered as nonprofit. He donated it what's reported to be something like $50 million to get it off the ground.

But in, in the beginning, it was like 2014 or 2015, they didn't have the transformer yet. So they didn't know how to make, like Je GP D work. They were primarily working on trying to have a, is that can play video video games in those days as sort of a proxy for being able to make decisions and so forth.

Like \\nGoogle\\n or \\nMicrosoft\\n, and then it won't open open A, I won't win. And so he turned a, he turned what had been a pure nonprofit into a nonprofit that owns a for profit. The employees of the nonprofit became employees of the for profit salaries went up a lot, the amount of money that they raised, went up a lot. Their, their, their ability to invest went up a lot. Speaker 3\\n02:33:29\\nWhat was Elon's participation for the original 50 million? Speaker 2\\n02:33:33\\nSo Elon has said publicly that he had nothing for it. What he says is he, it was a philanthropic donation. You're under tax laws, you can't just turn a for profit. You can't just turn in a profit into a for profit because it's a violation of tax laws. And so, II, I think legally they probably couldn't give him anything. But anyway, he says he, he says he got nothing for it. And he, he has said in public basically, he's like, wow, that seems like a new trick. Why, why doesn't everybody do it? And so he's, he has suggested over the, over the years that like there was something wrong with how they did this and you know, who knows? We'll see. But Sam made that change and, and by the way that worked, right, they were able to, they were able to all of a sudden start paying competitive salaries to \\nGoogle\\n for engineers. They were able to buy all the computer power they needed, they were able to buy, they have you know, they have lots of money going into making training data. And so like that, that part of it worked and that's what resulted in Chet GP T that's why Chet GP T exists and that's why Dolly exists. He did another thing along the way, which was he, he, he turned it basically into closed A I, so he, he, he, he, he turned it into a for profit and he canceled the part where it publishes everything and basically as of four years ago or five years ago or so, they stopped publishing their research and he did that under the theory that it is too dangerous to distribute. It's too, it's too powerful, too dangerous and other people can't, can't have it.

That it's just kind of, you know, you know, many hundreds of thousands of very smart engineers have been 20 years, you know, and big huge industries have been built trying to get this stuff to work.

Speaker 2\\n02:53:44\\nQuite a bit, quite a lot. Yeah, it's, it's an amazing. It's, I mean, you know, I for me, it's almost entirely long form, you know, it's, it's discussions, podcasts, even audio books, but it's just like the repository of information knowledge on \\nYouTube\\n. It's just, yeah, incredibly staggering. And then actually a lot of music, I do a lot of music listening on \\nYouTube\\n now. Speaker 3\\n02:54:01\\nHas it replaced other forms of visual media. Speaker 1\\n02:54:06\\nYeah, I think so. Yeah. Speaker 3\\n02:54:07\\nLess television, less movies, more \\nYouTube\\n. Speaker 2\\n02:54:10\\nWell, no, I don't watch, so I don't watch my, so my eight year old watches \\nYouTube\\n and preference in television movies. I don't do that if I'm watching television or movie, I want a very specific experience. It's usually with friends or at the end of the day and I want to watch, you know, whatever is the best new movie or whatever. So I'm not like, I, I'm, I just don't have the mode of like sitting and watching \\nYouTube\\n videos or TikTok videos the way a lot of people do. And it's just frankly, the life of time, I'm sure it would be very fun. But for me, it's basic, it's actually mostly actually for \\nYouTube\\n is audio content, mostly for me, it's an audio source. So I, I'm, I'm an audiobook podcast, spoken word guy, you know, like two hours a day, you know, driving around and running around and doing everything, getting ready in the morning. And so it's usually either I'm listening to a \\nYouTube\\n slash podcast or an audiobook. But you but \\nYouTube\\n has been taking a bigger and bigger share of that. Speaker 3\\n02:54:53\\nWhat was the piece you recently the optimist, what. Speaker 2\\n02:54:57\\nWas it called? The techno optimist manifesto, techno optimist manifesto. Speaker 3\\n02:55:02\\nPlease explain it to me. Yes. Speaker 2\\n02:55:04\\nIt's both radical and not radical at all. So this is my history. Obsession comes in So it's very radical and that it just, it says these things that we have very radical, which is technology is overwhelmingly net good. Capitalism is overwhelmingly net good. And basically the more technology and the more capitalism we get, the better things we're going to get. And I describe sort of in detail why that's the case. I describe in detail what the arguments are against that and why I think that they're wrong. I also described by the way, the limits to that position. The things that I'm also not claiming, but it's basically, you know, it's a call to arms for the kinds of people who build new products, build new technologies, build new companies. You know, I describe right up front in the piece that basically, I think we have all been on the receiving end of a demoralization campaign for the last 15 years to basically convince us that all these things are bad and evil. And I think it's basically, you know, people, it's a demoralization campaign is being run by people who are very threatened by change and people who are very resentful and bitter and we should not let them demoralize us into not making things better. And so, yeah, I, I really kind of went to town. I was inspired by a lot of prior manifestos. One in particular that I enjoyed tremendously, which is the futurist manifesto from the Italian futurist art movement. And the like around 1910. So I, I don't know that I, I don't know that I, I hit the bar of the futurist manifesto but that was kind of my, that was my sort of inspirational kind of starting point. And of course, that was an artistic aesthetic movement, not a technological movement, but it was at a time when they were very obsessed with new technologies and what new technologies would mean for art. So I hopefully I got a little bit of that flavor in there. Speaker 3\\n02:56:31\\nWhen is technology in that negative? Yeah. Speaker 2\\n02:56:34\\nSo, so when it kills a lot of people, when it, you know, basically when it causes misery, right? So, you know, look, fire, you know, I talk in the manifesto like all of our both optimism and fear of technologies is embedded in the myth of \\nPrometheus\\n who is the God that brought fire down from the mountain man. Fire is the life giver. Fire is the source of light and heat and cooks food and serves as, you know, warmth at night and scares off the wolves. And it allows us to mount, you know, defense fire is also a means of attack and you can use fire to burn somebody to death. You can burn down an entire city, you can fire flaming arrows. I've been reading about the history of in the middle of \\nMiddle East\\n stuff and they they, one of the reasons that they discovered there was oil in \\nthe Middle East\\n is because they were, the, the, the \\nArabs\\n of that region were early adopters of Napalm. In the mid 18 hundreds, they discovered a way to basically take petro, you know, chemical petrochemical substances and, and basically make, you know, essentially early Napalm with them. So like a lot of people died by fire and I mean, look like what is ammunition, you know, what's you know, we read about shelling, taking place somewhere, you know, that's bomb, they're setting up bombs, fire is the weapon of a bomb. Fire is the weapon of you know, the catalyst for a bullet. Fire. It's a huge power source is, you know, what does a nuclear weapon do? Is it generates fire, right? And so it, it's, it's like it's all in there, you know, but, but the thing is like you can say that basically, like it's really easy. The same thing, like I'm drinking water, you can drown in water. You know, you can use a shovel to dig a, well, you can use a shovel to close to death. It's a tool and I won't go so far as to say, tools are value neutral in that, you know, they carry consequences with them and specifically, they carry consequences to the ordering of human society, which is ultimately the thing that's being litigated when we talk about all this stuff. But that said they tend to have both you use cases and it is, you know, it is arguably easy to get carried away and just assume that it's only the upsides and I think it's also very easy to get carried away and to say that it's mostly downsides. I think most arguments about technology are not actually arguments about technology. I think the arguments about the ordering of society, I think most people opposed to technological change are not actually opposed to the technology per se. They're opposed to what they see as a diminishment of their own status and power. I think that's why the, you know, the news industry is so anti tech is because they view it as a challenge to their own, you know, their traditional gatekeeping role and their, and their historical businesses, you know, look is societal change, good or bad, you know, it depends, right. You know, we, we, we are all very happy, we don't live in the society order the way that they were 4000 years ago.\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Right. And, and, and what is that? Something else? It, it, to your point, it's the composite of all of human experience. But also it's not, this is very important. There's no, there's no, it in the way that we think about it, there's no person, there's no, there's no little person in there. There's no, there's no, I understand, right? It's not there. So there's no point of view. Another way of thinking about it, what it's doing is it's generating \\nNetflix\\n scripts, it's generating \\nNetflix\\n, it's generating machine. All it wants to do is tell you a story that you're gonna like. Speaker 3\\n02:45:03\\nTell me the different categories of software between the internet and my eyes, everything. What are all of those things that happen? What are all the different processes that happen software wise like using \\nNetscape\\n as an example of one of the pieces, but it's not all the pieces. So what does, what, what are all the pieces you need? Speaker 2\\n02:45:27\\nSo somewhere there's a piece of so say there's a piece of content you're looking at a web page that content is stored in a storage system somewhere. So stored in hard drive somewhere that's stored that is managed by a computer called a server that could be a, literally a computer sitting in a closet somewhere or it could be on, on in a cloud which is basically just a giant collection of computers kind of run, run as a big grid. And then there's, there's the hardware server computer and storage and then there's this, it's called server software. So there's the software that gets the request for the content and then responses with a request there, the. Speaker 3\\n02:45:60\\nSoftware would be built into that system. No, it's not a, it's not an added on piece. Speaker 2\\n02:46:04\\nYeah, it's, it's there server software. It's called a web servers piece of software which would run on a server computer. So, so the server, so usually the terminology we use is client server. So client is like what the user uses and the server is like what's running in the background somewhere. And so when I say server, that both means that can mean both the hardware itself of a computer in a closet somewhere. Or it can mean a piece of software running on that computer that does server like functions that tells it how to be a server basically. So their server software running up in the cloud that's. Speaker 3\\n02:46:33\\nAlways connected to the server. So it wouldn't be a general one that you would talk to other servers. It would only talk to that server, the software. Speaker 2\\n02:46:41\\nSo the simplest case is just a single computer, a single server computer with a single piece of server software on it. Now, in practice, most of what you have today is much more complicated than that. The systems have evolved to become a lot more powerful. And so probably what's actually happening. Like if you're looking at a web page today is probably you're accessing the server is a cloud of like a million computers and you're just hitting randomly one of those computers versus another one and there's a network switch that's balancing across the million other people that are trying to access the same content at the same time. So it's, it's become a very elaborate, you know, plate spinning exercise on the back end. And there's these giant businesses like \\nAmazon\\n web services that that, that manage all that, but it's still the same, what do you experience is still the same thing as far as you're concerned. It's just a server, it's just giving you content. There's probably two really critical Other things that happened back there, one is, there's a lot of work that goes into making this fast. And so there's, there's this process called caching. And so like there's probably another server that is actually closer to you that's like at the telecom company that use your wire wireless provider that has like a copy of that content already on it so that it doesn't have to actually go all the way up. And so there's this, it's called caching systems, performance systems. And then there's all these security systems, you know, the servers can get attacked, right. There's lots of hackers that want to like break in or disable these systems. And so these days, they have all these defense mechanisms to be able to fend off cyberattacks. Speaker 3\\n02:48:00\\nWhat would they want? What would a hacker want to get into it for? Speaker 2\\n02:48:03\\nSo a couple of things, one is to get a lot of it is to try to get the user data. So to try to get your name and password and credit card number or theft or they might want to maliciously change the content deface it, you know, graffiti artist, it's digitally or they might just want to destroy, they might want to actually take that that server offline, they might not want it to exist anymore. And what, what they do and they don't want it to exist anymore is the bad guys will do what's called a denial of service attack, which is Ad Os or D OS attack. And basically that means that the bad, the bad guys basically set up, you know, a large number of hostile computers to just barrage the server with like too many requests and cause it to basically melt down. And so there's all these elaborate systems by the way, the Chinese government does this. So the the the Chinese government has the, we know that we know that because it's not been well documented. So one of our companies was the first company that experienced this. So the Chinese have what's called the Great firewall which prevents their, their citizens from looking outside. The Great firewall consists of millions of computers that are being used for censorship and filtering. They have a capability to turn the Great firewall into something we call the Great Cannon. And so they can turn it into an outward bound attack and it's so big and so powerful that it can overwhelm any sort of small internet company. And even for the big internet companies, this could be hard to fight off. And so there's actually these pitched, there's almost these pitched digital wars that take place where the Chinese or other happening all the time or it's on occasion. Well, the Chinese aren't always doing it but there's, there's always denial of service attacks. Somebody is always trying to do it. So it's, it's actually not that expensive to run a denial of service attack. You might even just do it for commercial competition reason. You know, it's Christmas, you're competing with somebody if you're nefarious, right? What you would do is you would basically mount to denial of service attack against your competitors website so that they couldn't sell anything. Right. And I, I'm sure that's happened too, right? And then there are these things called botnets. And so one of the things that computer viruses do is if your, if your computer gets a virus. It gets basically recruited into a botnet and your computer ends up getting used to do these attacks or by the way, your toaster or your fridge. Right. So there, there's this, like, yeah, so there's this, like, there's this digital war that's kind of constantly taking place constant. Oh, North North Korea does a lot of hacking. They do a lot of hacking for financial reasons. They, they fund a lot of the, their military through, hacking for financial crimes and then they, they hire, third party, hacker rings on the internet to, to do it for them. And so, and then there's now, and then by the way, there's also like mass propaganda efforts. And so a lot of nation \\nStates\\n now have what they call covert influence teams where they're, you know, and then that form of the attack is to upload lots of fake content, right? And to try to overwhelm the, you know, the real content or, or, or whatever, you know, whatever, right. Like create lots of fake accounts. So there, there, whenever you are these days, whenever you are doing that, your computer is kind of maneuvering very elegantly through this kind of digital firestorm that's happening all the time. And so you generally never notice it but it is actually happening. But the, the amount of brain power and computer hardware that has been spent over the last 20 years trying to get these systems to be good at repelling all these attacks is actually quite, quite staggering. It's like this, this whole para parallel kind of Cyber Cyber War taking place. And of course, this is just the very beginning. Like these, these wars are gonna get like much more intense in the years ahead. We, we haven't yet had like a full, basically like military war that's been accompanied by a cyber war. But like what, you know, what everybody's worried about is like, OK, like it for somebody in \\nRussia\\n where decide to invade \\nGermany\\n, for example, with the first thing they do is take down the \\nGerman\\n power grid, you know, I don't know, maybe, right? And so you know, or, or, or basically, or, you know, maybe hack into all the self driving cars and cause them to all drive off the road or crash into each other, right? And so there, there's real world consequences more and more to, you know, to, to all these things. So anyway, so that's what's happening on the outside. And then basically, you've got your, you know, Wi Fi or whatever here or your cell connection and then you've got your computer and then your, your computer corresponding with your \\niphone\\n or your \\nMac\\n has, you know, many layers of software to basically deal with all that. Download the content, render the content for you, you know, that takes place in the web browser, you know, usually or the operating system somewhere then present it to you in a good way and then let you interact with it. And so that, that that's what's called the client. Speaker 3\\n02:52:03\\nAll there is, is the browser on your side or is there more than a browser? Speaker 2\\n02:52:08\\nYeah. Well, the browsers have gotten very complicated, right? So correspondingly the browsers are also not very sophisticated. And so for example, your brow, I'll give you an example, your browser has all sorts of security countermeasures in it also itself. And so if you download a piece of content that's been compromised and has like a malicious worm or virus inside it, your browser and your operating system have ways of detecting that and, and, and, and, and preventing you know that from infecting your system. So it's got that it's got all kinds of things in there for performance, making everything fast. It's got, you know, things in there for dealing with video and music on the. Speaker 3\\n02:52:37\\nSimplest level, forgetting the war aspects of it, even though those are real world concerns, the actual connection is pretty simple. It's a server talking to a browser right over the internet. Speaker 2\\n02:52:51\\nAnd you can still do exactly that like you, you, you can still run it exactly that way that still works in, in practice, nobody does that anymore because it's all gotten much more sophisticated behind the scenes, but not in a way that you would ever notice if all of the other complicated stuff is doing its job.

       " Document(page_content=\"Well, no. So it was a, it was, this was considered research, not development. And so the, the, the, the way that it was, it was like an internal scientific unit at a company. And so they actually published it as a paper. I see. And, and they're actually, there's a long history of this where this is actually a lot of the great breakthroughs over time have actually come out of like industrial research labs like this. And then they, and then the company that develops, it publishes it and then they don't realize until later that they should have kept it secret. But, but also the reason that they were able to hire all these great researchers out of all these universities is they promised them that they could publish their work, right? And so sort of part of the deal with these guys was that they would get to publish. So they, they had this key breaker in 2017. So, but, but it sort of became clear in the 20 tens that like there was finally progress being made and some of these systems were gonna start to work. And Elon had some conversation with \\nLarry Page\\n who was running \\nGoogle\\n at the time. And Larry said to Elon, you know, this A I thing is really gonna work and we're gonna end up with a is that are like, you know, much, you know, smarter and more powerful than people. And Elon said, well, aren't you worried that they're gonna like, have their own goals and they're gonna take over and they're not gonna want to surround anymore. And Larry's, Larry's response was you're being species, you're being racist, but towards your species. And if they're a better form of life, then they should take over and we should all die and humanity should go away. Now knowing Larry, I think there's at least a 50% chance he was joking, but Elon couldn't tell and took him seriously. And so Elon had a visceral reaction and was like, oh my God, like the big risk here is not just developing A I, the big risk here is \\nGoogle\\n develops A I and \\nLarry Page\\n is in control of it. And he does horrible, horrible things. And so he started, he's like, oh, so he called all these people who he knew. And he said we need to start the competitive effort to that today and we need to call it, I mean, it needs to be as opposed to \\nGoogle\\n's closed A I, it needs to be open A I and, and this was to protect the world is to protect the world in Elon's views, to protect the world. So, what Elon says is we need to go hire all the best researchers we can. Speaker 3\\n02:29:34\\nIt seems to be, that's what he's always done. It's like \\nTesla\\n was, cars need to be electric. Space X\\n was, if anything happens to the earth, we could live on \\nMars\\n, he's always motivated by saving the planet. Speaker 2\\n02:29:48\\nThat's right. And, and, and, and humanity. Right.

       " Document(page_content=\"Basically in there. And so these people in the 19 thirties knew that there was this difference. And so they said, should we model these things after a calculating machine in which they are hyper literal, like you say almost autistic, right? Which is like they're just like it was like Savant like machines where they're like really good at running large numbers of mathematical calculations very fast and then we'll give people, the ability to write programs based on that, but they're never going to be good at patterns. They're never gonna be good at language. They're never gonna be good at, they're never gonna know what anything means. You know, they, they're always going to be hard to talk to. You're never gonna be able to use natural language interface. You know, they're never gonna be able to know the difference between, you know, the, the difference between a cat and a cinnamon roll and a photo. Like they're just not gonna be good at that. So they'll be like hyper literal in that way, it's super fast but hyper literal and then humans will just still be completely different or should we try to build computers that are modeled after the human brain? And, and so it actually turns out the, the first paper on the concept of the neural network, which is the architecture of Cha A GP T it was actually written in 1943. And the A I systems we use today are still based on the ideas in that paper. So it is 80 years ago, right? So they knew enough about neuron structures and synapses in the brain that they knew. They were 43 1943. No, but, but they knew and by the way, look, the field of A I started in like 1943 like that actually fired the starting gun. And actually people have worked for the last 80 years trying to get neural networks to work and they finally just started to work. But my point is like, they, they knew from the very beginning there were these two totally different ways of making computers and they knew what the trade offs were and they just were. But it just turned out that historically, they were able to make the one kind of computer for the last 80 years. And that created the computer as we know it today. And then it turns out there's this completely other way to make a computer and that's based on the, it, it's inspired by, it's not the same as the brain, but it's inspired by the structure of the brain. And as a consequence, it's a new kind of computer and a way to think about it is, it's a computer that's actually an A I computer is actually very bad at all. The hyper literal stuff, right? And so, for example, J GP T has this thing called Hallucinates. And so if you ask it a question and it knows the answer, it gives you the answer. If it doesn't know the answer, it just makes one up. Speaker 3\\n02:18:31\\nSo it's more creative and less accurate. Exactly. Speaker 2\\n02:18:34\\nSome, somebody once said that somebody said that one of the guys who studies this says A I is not like a computer, it's like a pretty good person. It's not like the best person, but it's like a pretty good person. And what do we know about? Pretty good people? They're right. A lot of the time but a lot of the time they're not. And can you always tell the difference? Not necessarily, you know? Do they sound as confident when they're wrong as when they're right? Yeah. Do they know? No, they don't if you ask. Speaker 3\\n02:18:56\\nIt sounds like a real issue if we've spent 80 years establishing the fact that what you're getting back from a computer is more like a results from the results from a calculator. But now we're getting these fuzzy results that are more like mediocre human results, even though we've had 80 years of what we think of as accurate, that could create confusion. Speaker 2\\n02:19:23\\nSo there was a court case about three months ago where a lawyer had Chet GP T write a legal argument to be presented to a judge in a court and it did it and it hallucinated several court cases precedents that don't exist and the judge caught, it just made them up, made him up and they sound great. By the way, they sound exactly like court cases. The whole thing hangs together logically. It's just literally not true. It's mentioned cases that didn't happen. And so, and it turns out if you submit false made up court cases in court, you get disbarred as a lawyer, like you're done being a lawyer. And so the judge basically like came very close to disbarring the lawyer on the spot and the lawyer is basically a lawyer. The judge is like, did you use judge EPT to do this? And the lawyer basically fessed up and the judge basically said, if you ever do this again, I'm going to disbar you and destroy your career. But it's exactly for that reason. But however, hallucination, creativity. Speaker 3\\n02:20:09\\nBe a great scene in a movie. For example, we find in a movie. Speaker 2\\n02:20:13\\nWell, so and it actually turns out so there, there are companies now building A I for lawyers and, and actually we, we, so we did a bunch of work, we haven't invested yet, but we've done, we've done a bunch of work in this space because one of the things that A I can do is it can like write, you can write legal briefs and if it doesn't hallucinate, they're actually really good legal briefs. And so we, we've been talking to like professional lawyers about this and what the, what the professional lawyers will tell you actually is, you actually don't just want accuracy. When you're thinking about writing legal briefs, you actually do want creativity because there are different ways to make legal arguments. And maybe the way that you've thought of on your own is not the best way to do it. And maybe if you had a copilot, right? Think of you're writing a legal brief, you're a lawyer, you have a legal, you're writing a legal brief, you have a copilot. Right. And, and that copilot is just giving you ideas, right? And some of the ideas are going to be great idea. Some of the ideas are gonna be terrible ideas, but they're all new ideas, the ideas where you don't have to sit and come up with them on your own. Right? And so what the lawyers are saying basically is like in that case, you actually, you actually, you want some hallucinating, right? You, you, you don't want make up a court case that didn't happen but you want, oh, here's a different way to make the same argument, right? Or, or you might also view it as like if you're writing a closing argument to be presented to a jury like that, you know, as you know, it's like a storytelling exercise. And so you might want actually, you know, some brainstorming, you don't want the thing to do it for you because you're the guy who has to stand up there and actually present it and you have to really be willing to stand behind it, but it might be helpful to have a writing partner that can actually help you do that. And so there, there's this sort of double edged, like the fact that it Hallucinates is both a big problem, but it's also magical because we've never had computers that make things up before. Like that's a brand new thing. If you had told me three years ago, we're gonna have computers that like make up like it's never, it's never happened. There's never been a way to do that. It's the same thing and now you're seeing it, it's the way to see this really clearly. Of course, is visual design, visual art, you know, coming out of like mid journey or da or these things where it will make up all of these crazy art things and you know, look half the time it will make up like it will. And you know, there's this famous thing, they've figured it out now. But for a long time, the way that you could tell that computer art was being made by algorithm was it just, it would give extra fingers, it just turned out that the training data it was trained on. It just like it just turns out like human, human bodies relatively straightforward, except that there are these like detailed finger appendages. And if you are looking at a billion photos or pictures of people, they have fingers in all kinds of different positions. And so the early versions of the A I basically just didn't know how to do fingers accurately. They fix that now, right where it no longer does that. But by the way, if you want it to, it still will, right? And so if you tell it, render me a scene where everybody has seven fingers, it will happily do it for you. And computers never used to be able to do that, right? Or if you just want to tell it to use it, one of the things you can do, it is really fun with these things is you can do it. You can say like use your imagination or, or you can say another thing you can do is you can say, so there's this thing called prompt engineering. So it's how do you write out the prompt that tells the A I what to do, right? So which is true for both a text A I and for an image A I do the prompt. And it turns out there was a research thing done by \\nGoogle\\n a few, a few months back about what's the optimal prompt that, that optimizes the chance that there won't be hallucinations that it's gonna be the most likely to be what's called factually grounded. And it turned out the opal prompt starts with, take a deep breath really gives you the best results, right? And, and, and so, and, and, and this gets to the, the, the amazingness of what's happening.\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Speaker 2\\n48:07\\nYeah, look. So, so, and I would say \\nGoogle\\n if it was in this interesting position where number one, they invented a lot of these A I technologies, right? And so the key breakthrough for Chet GP T actually happened at \\nGoogle\\n in 2017 in classic the company form, they sat on it. They didn't, they didn't use it. If you talk to people in \\nGoogle\\n, they will tell you that \\nGoogle\\n could have had GP T chat, GP T for the way you have it today, they could have had it in 2019.
