      "page_content=\"today we're joined by EO Liberty CEO and founder of pine cone Pine cone's a vector database that's raised over $130 million most recently at a $750 million valuation and they've really become a core part of the common set of tools that folks use to build AI apps we hit on a bunch of really interesting areas including the vector database landscape and how it's evolving common barriers that enterprises have to building effective AI apps Ando also shared his thoughts on the infrastructure and AI opportunities ahead in the application layer as well I think folks are really going to enjoy this definitely stick around for patent my debrief here at unsupervised learning you know thanks so much for uh for coming on really appreciate it thank you guys you know you were obviously working on Pine Cone before this generative AI craze and you know the launch of chat GPT and what was it like for you guys when chat GPT came out I mean was it like immediately clear there's going to be some spike in usage or when did you first kind of start observing just uh the insanity that I imagine followed I'll start by saying that Vector bases I think are uh still vastly underutilized for a lot of use cases for semantic search for candidate generation for ranking for feed ranking for like recommendation for a million different things right when I started building Pine con this was really it was sort of like a well-kept secret well a well-known secret I should say that the bigger companies like Google Amazon you know whatever like use that internally for search for recommendation for feed ranking for anomaly detection and so on but then educating the market was fairly difficult and I would go to you know investors and say you know database and they would kind of look at me confused and and concerned and I'm sure they emailed you in in 2023 and they were like we believed all along right we've always been fans of the category yeah uh actually I'll tell you funny a funny thing that I the actual emails I got after that but just to make matters worse I had just come out of AWS where I I helped build a product called sag maker which was EML Ops thing and like EML Ops was like all the older age uh you know before you know AI kind of took off right so everybody thought it was building a like an mlops product right so everybody was very happy to meet with me and then be very disappointed that I'm building something called the vector database what is that like it sounds like saying right and then with open AI just kind of elevating uh the discussion to the broader audience like the technology really hasn't changed significantly to be honest I mean the the the for practitioners like nothing very deep has changed except for the fact that now there was a lot of oomph behind it a lot of capital and a lot of energy behind it so it started started being accessed by the non AI engineer when that started happening we started ramping up so quickly that we started really exhausting whole all kinds of machines in in gcp and AWS clouds we started like really spending millions of dollars a month on our free tier it was complete Insanity it was uh the entire team was dedicated just like spinning up more and more environments and just being able to keep up with the demand I think at our Peak we started having 10,000 signups every day uh which really pushed us to really think about scale and effic iy in a completely different way like we we kind of we had to go back to the drawing board and redesign the entire solution which later yielded the solution we have in place called now called serverless which is like maybe two orders of Mag more efficient but it kind of came out of just necessity we just couldn't we literally couldn't handle the load uh the funny thing is if you want to talk about Investors right I did have quite a few different investors write to me after like that like vector that basis have become like the like a true category in some sense we've already taken the lead and they say they went when they when they wrote to me and said hey you know I actually looked back at the notes that I took like three years ago and you actually said you were going to build this and I like yeah uh because that that's what I was going to build and they're like okay like we just that just not very common that somebody says they're going to build something and they actually build it and that's actually succeeds like that's just not very common I'm like so funny I guess they they'd all thought it was uh in mlops platform but then they they read they read back through their notes and they they realized what it was what it was all along exactly was there like a particular moment that you can remember that like spiked usage you know early on was it like immediately apparent to folks as they were playing around with gpt3 that they needed the vector database or was there like a tweet or something something or uh in the early days of that usage spiking I think one of one of the kind of moments that really just completely blew up there was this uh uh uh there was this open source like gadget called a auto GPT that was this sort of like super like minimalistic but sort of like precursor to something we would call an agent now and it was sort of like a a piece of nothing it was really just like a uh what I think even one python file or just a handful of python files with some like spit and gum and you know whatever but it it like like agents do it started like doing something potentially interesting it was open source and so on that thing just took off like crazy and you know suddenly the people's assorted onboarding pine cone were not systems engineer building AI platforms and rag applications and and so on they were like the dentist that remembers python from college and wants to play with AI right and then like things just completely went insane like because there's way more dentists I guess a lot of dentists that uh that remember their luckily enough that kind of like normalized again and the people who come today oh mostly Builders but for a while there it just completely went insane yeah it seems like there's a a huge breadth of applications that are built on top of of pine cone what are some of your favorite applications or or some of the ones that that really stand out to you obviously we're talking about notion before and um and it sounds like pine cone really shines for scale as well when people have kind of millions of vectors that um that they want to to run workloads on top of so Millions is actually the small scale today when we speak with customers and they have millions of vectos we say great uh you KN knock yourself out you'll be hard pressed to spend more than 100 bucks a month uh like you really are going to have to exert energy to try to do that right where we truly shine is at the hundreds of millions the billions scale where companies themselves are are sass uh in and often times like software providers notion is a great example gong is a great example many others that actually they themselves develop AI Q&A semantic search like deep AI solutions for their own customers data so they like each one of their own customers might have a million documents right but they themselves and have 10,000 customers and suddenly they find themselves needing a vabase that can handle 10 billion ineds maybe across a thousand partitions or 10,000 partitions and do that incredibly cost effectively right and when you try to do that especially nowadays where people really start understanding hey I'm not just playing in the lab I'm building a tree a true product so I really need to care about unit economics they want to figure out what's like what's that going to cost me and then we can come in and say hey because of our new architecture because we went through this insane spike a year and a half ago and we've re architected everything and now we've launched it as serverless we can run this multi-tenant workload such that one of you your cost for one of your paying customers on Pine Cone might be a dollar a year like like sometimes 50 cents a year right for a paying user right and then the unit economics really shine right so you you said you know if you have a million you know vector right I mean a a million vectors like okay if you have a million vectors 10,000 times you really don't want that to be 100 bucks each you really want each one of them to be 50 cents each and then that starts making sense right uh and that's where we truly shine because then you really can can operate this thing at scale on the application side are most people running rag or doing semantic search or um I guess what types of applications do you see I can imagine you know the Q&A at notion that's kind of one and then I can imagine there's tons that gong is doing as well with with vectors and turning videos into vectors yeah Q&A and semantic search are very large applications very well understood chat Bots support Bots uh which are sort of like Q&A if you will uh but in special flavor of that uh people do uh legal Discovery U medical history Discovery and all sorts of you know analytics on that uh which again you can think about them as flavors of search in in some sense right there's a lot more that has to do with images and audio and video and anomaly detection and security which is starting to become like a big thing Pharma and Drug Discovery are you know we see some applications like that but the kind of meat and potato is really just the kind of text and and images and search and uh you know rag over that in some sense and by the way rag in and of itself is sort of like like you know based on semantic search it's it's like the the kind of the magic sauce happens at the ma at the semantic search layer not at the reformulation the year that makes a lot of sense and and and I guess obviously you know I think in the beginning folks have used you know embeddings for it feels like mostly Text data and there's been you know some in the image world but I'm wondering you know we've had different perspectives on on this podcast about you know how much multimodal stuff we'll see this year and whether you know I'm curious you obviously have a firsthand view to it uh you know are you seeing lots of folks uh working with image and video data and and do you think that we have the underlying tools required to for those use cases today or or you still expected to be a text dominant 2024 so look I mean I am unfortunately I've been in AI or machine learning before that or Big Data before that or all that you know for 20 years now and so uh uh I think I have a good mix of uh enthusiasm about the the the promise of tomorrow and a healthy focus on the problems of yesterday right uh even today right with the advance of foundational models and you know General Ai and all that stuff the average Company still finds it hard to even like train any deep learning model at all yeah like anything like a million parameter not a billion not 10 billion not General AI nothing like any model same goes to search and and so on so you know I think we need to be very uh kind of realistic about what is possible right by the Trailblazers the research labs and the technology leaders and what is an actual technology that companies actually use right and those could be five years apart sometimes right so can we already see amazing things with multimodal for sure right do I think multimodal is going to head the kind of mainstream technology developer in the next year or two unlikely yeah I mean I think it's interesting because you you are working hand inand with these companies that are uh deploying in many times their their first generative AI products and so I imagine you do see these barriers or or the places where folks fall down and being able to do that like what do you feel like the biggest barriers today in terms of getting you know these training these models and getting them into production for some of the classic use cases that we're seeing around you know support or or search or others I mean one of the biggest ones is hallucinations right they're just they're not trustworthy right they just don't whatever they they're compelled they're large language models they're designed to generate language right uh and when you are compelled to write a page of text on something you know nothing about you will write a page of text uh and that will contain stuff you know Pat and I do that all the time I was going to say yeah we've all been in like sixth grade and I remember that experience very well like cold sweat I'm like [\\xa0__\\xa0] um that's the mode we put these llms in right uh and so like and then we're so sort of like surprised that what comes out is is nonsense right I think that's a huge problem and I think that's something that we as a technology would have to a society I mean not we Pine con I mean we the world have to Grapple with and really bring really good solutions to I think it will start with AI startups and technology companies that build on Pine Cone build on models and so on that have already know how to work with those Technologies building great vertical solutions for support for medical history for legal Discovery for you know you name it like that's a very long list of applications right right and then I think two three years down the line you would see maturity in the broader Market where now like every large company would use some of those tools but would also use Vector bases and models and you know visibility and like a bunch of other AI specific Technologies kind of natively for for the own development where this has become so commonplace so well understood so Ironclad and so well like ingrained in the developer culture that just people whatever there's just enough there that people just know how to use it well I feel like hallucinations come up time and time again I guess have have you seen what what do you feel like the best way to you know for for folks listening they they're also trying to figure this out what are what are some of the best things you're seeing in terms of ways to get around this there are a few different really important efforts on this front first of all we we are only now starting to truly be able to even measure hallucinations right to even know like you can for example you can design a model I can write a model uh that never hallucinates by just always saying I don't know right right that's not hallucinating right it's also completely useless but it it never makes a mistake and you know whatever like it never miss steps right uh okay is this worthwhile like should we should we uh celebrate that outcome I don't think so right okay so you really want to measure kind of usefulness and correctness and faithfulness to the data that you were trained on or the data that you have in a vual database to do ragon and so on so the just these measures of even what is good is is is already like a very complicated question and I think that there is a uh a another huge effort that has to do with frankly with Rag and with Vector databases and with knowledge layers and capacities and people grappling with okay how do I now make my data available to the model in a way that's secure that is well understood that is data governed that you know I can maybe delete stuff that I whatever like I was gdpr told me that I have to delete and somehow I need to know for a fact it's not somehow a part of model anymore and so on um there's a lot of work there and that's you know a topic we actually made a lot of progress on already so by we again I mean not only pine cone but this like Community like starts to have pretty good solutions for super cool it seems like a Hacker News Post in the making an llm that will never hallucinate just respond with I don't know every single time uh like creatively avoid the question exactly but we know like we know I mean jokes aside we we already today can load all of whatever like a oh but a good chunk of the internet uh into pine cone as as an index and basically R run like a language model next to it with you know not incredibly sophisticated Rag and already outperform gp4 like today it's we've already ran experiments like this so like I I think there's something there and I think we're we're going to see some significant progress there both on sort of like consumer facing products and like B2B products vectors are the language of AI U or kind of what AI speaks and there's this land grab to store them everyone wants to store the vectors and because of that there's kind of been this explosion I mean you would know this better than than us but there's been this explosion of startups uh that are going after storing vectors but then also incumbents and folks like [\\xa0__\\xa0] that are adding support for vectors so how do you think about the landscape of you know the startups that are kind of vying to to store some of these workloads and then the incumbents as well don't get me started about [\\xa0__\\xa0] it's a company that freaking heard the word AI for the first time a year ago and suddenly they're like experts so I mean don't whatever like storing vectors I think is exactly what's happening and I think you define it perfectly right people understand that now this is a data type right next to my sentences or my images I'm going to store a semantic representation of that object that came out of some embedding model right and that thing is a float array right it's whatever like a thousand floats right and if your infrastructure be it like a non- AI technology say that rhymes with Bongo uh you know you need to put that array of numbers somewhere and so they have to have that as a type really and that's basically what's happening there right and so you know whatever you there's some work that has to be done to do that that doesn't make your database natively be able to query those things and work with that data type at all right what people don't understand about Vector bases and why they're so unique is that that that numeric array becomes in some sense the key some conceptual way that is the primary lookup that is the way you organize data on blob storage that's how you load segments that's how you you know search through the your Universe by the way that's how your own brain does it right I mean this is an incredibly unique and optimized stack that if you you know try to somehow bolt on this like data type and like pretend that it's now a vector database you're going to get incredibly poor performance and and flank run into like serious issues now I mean I think it's it's really interesting because um you know I feel like obviously yeah a lot of a lot of other folks have um have come into the space and I think generally there's been this question of like you know what's the what's the rag stack end up being and I feel like you guys get thrown around all the time as as a key part of that and I'm wondering like if you uh you know if you had to go to a company today uh and build a rag product like what would be your stack besides pine cone of course that's interesting I I I frankly I think a lot of people default to open a uh I I wouldn't we actually see really good performance out of smaller cheaper uh somehow easier to manage sometime open source models the there is no reason to spend a ton of money on that there is sort of like like an ml etling part of it has to do with bulk Transformations and movement of data and so on we've really started enjoying any scales product and we really like start partnering with them closer and we're really enjoying their stack uh we work with h forel and others on kind of uh launching applications and and you know building the the you know kind of app layer uh you know we partner pretty closely with coher and AI 21 and and uh you know we're put you know others like hugging face and others like we're all whatever they're all in the mix we see I think a good combination of of those models both for embedding and for uh ranking and summarization and so on I really don't have a good vendor for or a good technology for evaluation yet that I'm you know I'm going to some people people are going to write back to me that they're angry that I didn't name them but uh I think that uh uh that'd be very interesting to for a a leader to emerge in in that stack I think it's it's it's very interesting and it's very hard to do right and and then as you think about kind of like Pine cone's footprint I mean obviously I imagine a key part of of getting pine cone to work in an Enterprise just having the data ready to to be put into a vector database right and I imagine there's all sorts of you know we've obviously met companies that are that are focused on that and then there's you know the metadata you apply to it obviously then the retrieval methods you use to to uh to uh take it from a vector database like how do you think about ultimately like the footprint you want to have versus you're like I would love I would love there to be a best-in-class vendor that's that's great at the ETL side and and never have to touch that yeah so um you're right I mean I and by why I apologize to the the the audience I'm like a I'm like a infrastructure guy so I I kind of look at the raw machines and like very basic infrastructure a lot of companies that uh are stepping into the embedding generation and data generation into V datab bases that're actually doing really well right uh unstructured uh comes to mind but that is becomes a viable option like very soon and for especially for specific channels right so if you have a a fixed so if you have a common data Channel say you import your data say with five Tran from Snowflake and now you have that data in a in a table that has a unified structure because whatever because it's the same table that every five Trend customer would have then there are companies who would take that and and transform it and fit it into a vector base so you can rag over your you know say you know Salesforce you know notes on customers and so on right uh and so if people if you understand that the data source that you have is like standard then it's very likely you will find somebody who will have already buil that pipeline be very happy to sell it to you and you were talking about how uh how effective some of the smaller models can be relative to an open AI yeah how much intelligence do you think will happen at the vector DB retrieval step versus at the generation step it sounds like you know maybe over time people are you know they want to run on on their own data and and um you know maybe you guys are seeing good results with with that as well like I'll give an economics answer to this right the Market's going to have to find like the stable point where there's a good tradeoff between cost compute and infrastructure that you're willing to run and the quality of the output right we're already at the point where making models bigger on gpus is not reasonable you can run an experiment you know you can flex and say I have you know whatever 100 billion parameter model and it's whatever it's like does XYZ but whatever you're not going to run a 100 billion parameter model for every API call on your platform that's you're going to just it's just you're going to go bankrupt right and you're going to make the planet hotter so like that that's not going to work long term and so people really have to find better Solutions right again what we see is that with those model models uh if you do things right sometimes the the results could even get better and if they're even if they're not better they're not noticeably worse and you might be operating on like you know cents on the dollar uh in terms of operating costs right so yeah um I have no doubt that we would move there that doesn't mean the arms raised to whatever like bigger better models not going to exist I just don't think that's what the Market's G to operate with the kind of the most of the Market's going to operate with it is interesting it feels like as these context windows were getting longer you know these last few months people were like oh well you know is is there a future for rag you just stuff you know everything you'd want and in impr prompt but I mean I'm curious your thoughts on that it seems like from a cost perspective obviously uh that that you know if you're charging per token that that can get pricey quickly yeah I mean I I think the fact that model companies allow you to bring in a bigger and a bigger context I mean I think this is the least surprising thing in the world that's their pricing model right what like shockingly enough they're willing for you to pay them more what what a what a you know what a shocker there multiple problems with not only is it slow and expensive it doesn't actually help more often than not right and uh and finally it just runs out of steam right you can say Hey you know whatever like write me a job description and here is an example job description to go off of great that's great for a context window right if like here like 10 job descriptions to go off of okay that also works he a million job descriptions to go off of like okay that's not going to work right or whatever like write something and then get information from the web or get information from all of my documentation ever right uh that just doesn't work I mean just think about that like sending all your company data to open AI on every query like that clearly is not the right thing totally I mean it makes it makes all the more sense as you focus on these perfect uses for pinec con that are hundreds of millions of vectors it's like those are exactly the ones that you know would would never make any sense to stuff in a context window yeah but but even even even at the small scale I again I'm you know I want to paint the extreme because like that's where it becomes like almost like faral like obviously impossible right but even when you can create like a whatever put a 100,000 tokens in a in in a context window I mean putting those documents in a vector database you might be able to send instead of 100,000 you''ll be able to send 10,000 and that' be just as good if not better whatever 3,000 and you'd be paying whatever like 10% and not lose any performance so why not right and so again even small cases where the context engine is theoretically workable even then it's very rarely that right the best solution in terms of cost and performance totally and I guess just generally as you think about how folks are using pine cone today does it feel like there's you know folks relatively standardized around the embeddings models they use or retrieval methods or one thing I'm always curious about is whether you know uh it feels like at in the limit there will be you know different retrieval methods for different use cases and different embedding models that are particularly good for you know uh different Industries and uh it's hard to tell from the outside how much of that is happening today versus like hey let's just try and get this thing to work you know know and and use uh but I'm curious what you're seeing frankly most companies are trying to get this to work right very few companies have done it long enough and have like really gotten the experience with it that they really start to now iterate over the embedding models and the retrieval and the reranking and the filtering and like really get very deep in the application stack and and figure out how to build this and uh I think we're getting there it's a part of the maturity in the market like and the same way that any search recommendation stack is it's not just the retrieval there's like a lot that goes before it and a lot that goes after it uh to really get the results that you need and this is one of the main discussions that I have with larger companies that I work with that you know I tell them hey you know this is going to be able to do amazing things but it's not Magic I mean it's not you're not going to just hook it up and everything's going to be perfect this is you know this is work you know we're going to have scientists and Engineers work on this thing for multiple quarters and we're going to learn and iterate and improve and add stuff and remove stuff and we'll get there eventually we'll be able to do Q&A incredibly well and you know chat support and legal Discovery and all that stuff it is possible because we've been building these things for years now and we know it's possible we also know it's not trivial like and every use case is slightly different and every application has different preferences and different Comfort zones on the ratio between speed and cost and accuracy and and format and length of the input and the output and like freshness of the data and like you you name it there you just really have to build up a whole solution around it and that takes time and I imagine you know one thing that must be interesting for you as a business is and I've heard this from other folks that selli tools and Enterprises is you kind of land in and I'm sure they're like oh this is amazing we have you know EO and this awesome pine cone team like build out our Q&A you know product for us or something and and you know they're so excited to have you there and obviously you know I think at at scale you you you certainly want to be empowering the developers in these companies to you know uh to to build these things and to tweak things themselves like how have you thought about you know where you're just hey it's the early days of the space like we might as well just come in and help them tune the knobs and and make this implementation work uh versus you know hey we really want to um we're kind of about to be a little more religious about them just you know being playing around with with the different things Pine has to offer so for uh the first three years of the company's existence uh my uh board was uh very unhappy with me because we were almost religiously not doing that like we would get questions and we would whatever everything that we stood was needed we either documented very clearly that we don't do or we made it very very easy or maybe completely transparent uh and pine con just completely something you don't have to do at all or something that we don't do at all like either we take care of it 100% or we do zero% of it right and then we were very explicit about that right we had to often times have very uncomfortable conversations with potentially large customers that need help with XYZ and we know how to do XYZ and we tell them no we can't help you because we're really busy building a Victor database but that really panned out in the growth phase of the company where you you really started having literally thousands of customers who not only don't like seek our help they're not willing to meet with us they're like they're just happy and successful and they don't want to waste their time it's like hey this [\\xa0__\\xa0] works I don't I have better things to do I don't need to talk to you guys I'm like okay and so my sales team is agonizing about like hey like this is whatever we need to speak with them we don't know who they are I'm like I don't know but they don't want to talk to us what do you want to do for the folks that like you know maybe are not talking to you and and can't get it to work like is there one like thing you wish that people tried more like oh if only you would like use a different embeddings model or I don't know whatever it is like is there one kind of common failure mode you see for people are that are trying this and can't get it to work yeah so I will say that as a company also we've we've grown and evolved then companies that do want to help do want our help we engage with them we we're not like a Professional Services team right we won't go and build a whole solution but we're very very happy to help and and uh consult people on their journey and we've started doing that a lot more now that we have more capacity obviously in a team um um I think what people really get wrong is is cost estimations right I mean this is one of those things that just you know people come to me and like oh we did the napkin math and like we would pay you know $50,000 a month to Pine Cone and that doesn't make sense to us I'm like how did you compute that and then they would tell you and you're like oh my God like you know you just kind of like just walk them through the the cost calculators like 500 bucks a month I'm like oh okay like great I'm really I'm I'm really happy we had this conversation right so yeah designing their AI solution even if it's it could like seem like a small change but that might make a huge difference in the cost of the infrastructure and latencies and freshness and a bunch of other stuff so we're very happy to help with that people get that wrong on a regular basis and for me again as a technologist if you use the wrong embedding models sure your results might be slightly worse slightly better you can fix that if you calculated the costs and you now don't embark on the journey because you figured it was going to be too expensive and that calculation was wrong you've just like you're not even building something that you should be building uh and that for me is a is a kind of sort of more final failure mode which is much more painful and frankly annoying because I you know I hear about some of those things in hindsight well some really large customer would say oh we thought about you guys but then uh like we figured we can't run this project and then you're like W uh on the cost side one thing that we see across a lot of our infrastructure companies is they ship an improvement that makes the database or whatever it is is much more efficient and then people actually end up storing less or there's less compute um or it cost customers less my guess is with the serverless announcement that customers could potentially be paying you less than they otherwise would have because you know they're now it's a totally serverless model like was that something uh what was it like shipping that change and um you know ultimately um the best thing for your customers but uh potentially at the expense of some short-term Revenue like how did how did you think about um kind of moving to the the serverless model no it's it's very painful for us as a company and like for Founders listening this is it's it's a hard transition and you know for investors to see your Revenue kind of go up into the right in exactly the right exponent and suddenly that thing starting to flatten out and you tell them hey look at workloads actually grow faster now right but revenue is impacted by the fact that our product is so much cheaper now right um that is a complicated discussion and that like you know investors don't necessarily love to see that and even though they sort of like uh they understand it uh uh of course they can rationalize it but they still emotionally react badly to it right uh my advice to Founders is that kind of transition is much easier done earlier than later uh and so you should really move and do that as fast as you can and take the hit as soon as possible right um you know uh for us we think we're leaving on the table more than half of our revenue for some of the customers is going to be uh 70 80 90% uh reduction in cost for extreme cases in Pharma and others where the workload is like super super super uh like storage heavy this could be as as little L one or two% of the spend like we have companies they used to pay us 100K they now pay us $2,000 a month a year sorry it's like literally almost nothing right uh so they're very happy I mean un investors are not very happy about that but uh at the end of the day it's uh it's it's it's the right thing for the customer and it's the right thing for people Building Solutions on top of our platform and so if we can fit really nicely into their own cost structure of their own products we're not going to be a part of the stack right and you know when I think about the trajectory of the AI stack we're really in the very first of that like every sign shows that the adoption curve is such that like we're very early adopters you know um you know Trailblazers just getting to production and so on at the end of the day like almost every company is going to have a vector base doing something either small or medium or large uh we're not there yet and so you know if that's where we aim if we need to fit snuggly into that cost structure for like tens of thousands of or hundreds of thousands of different workloads we just have to do that even you you know that there a lot of you know pain uh in the medium term well yeah one thing you know I I was struck by as he he were kind of talking about how we're in the early days of you know AI infrastructure um you know a question that every investor always and and folks in the ecosystem are always asking is what are kind of net new categories for startups versus you know natural places for comments to build product obviously it seems like Factor databases have been one of the space where there's been a lot of net new companies you know yourselves at the Forefront as you look at the other parts of AI infrastructure like what parts do you think make sense for new players what parts are like the existing infrastructure players going to provide well uh Curious how you think about that you know frankly I much more excited about the application and the the the solution space more than the uh infrastructure layer right I mean for new companies right this is uh um in infrastructure there's a win or take all uh uh you know phenomenon that clearly works great for us but but that also just means that the you know the the uh where just the space for for new companies is is very limited right on the solution and application side I think there is so much energy and so much excitement and so many different uh problems that can be solved in Creative new ways now that uh I frankly think every you know every digital native has uh whatever like 20 different startups that like say now oh like we are the new blah with AI right and uh now they you know so you have 20 startups trying to uh usurp uh some some some long-term player and you have that long-term player trying to reassert themselves as an AI uh Native solution uh and at the same time you have Enterprises both buying those Technologies and learning how to use them uh and so this it becomes like this conveyor belt of innovation from Tiny startups all the way down up to Enterprises uh that is just teaming with with Innovation and and great ideas and a ton of value so I I you know again I literally see hundreds of customers hundreds of like companies a week that that work with us and so on and like each and every one of them does something unique and interesting and you're like holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] there's yet another application wow there's more Val this I didn't think about this okay amazing that's I guess so wow what a fun kit right I mean I I know you're an infrastructure guy but if you uh if if you couldn't do ponco and and had and were instead building an AI application what would you build it's G to sound uh weird to you but I I just really love uh communication like like uh email and slack and Twitter and like I just love that kind of data you know meetings re like transcriptions and like conversations and uh so there's something about human communication written or spoken that is uh I feel like just fascinating and and and there's like a ton of knowledge to be extracted it's all like super Missy and exciting and complicated and and very rich and you know it will be something like that whether it's medical records or emails or jira tickets or what have you like it would be something like that I thought you were going to say something around surfing but uh Communications make sense too I wish I wish there was like some yeah this I thought we were limiting the scope to Ser to uh tech companies if it was probably harder to build a really strong software business in surfing I was like Wonder I was imag like embeding surfing videos or something you know for technique coaching yeah could have a tech company where I uh surf every day and then pretend to have worked uh on something techology there's actually just an AI That's running the whole time you're surfing there's an agent that's doing all the work exactly this is like my software company in the Mal Dives on yeah I'm I'm honestly convinced with some of Pat's hallucinations that's what's happening on uh on his end I I guess you know also I mean you obviously were were're previous lit to you know interesting places I mean curious like your reflection on on maybe we'll go back to the most recent one in Amazon like how do you kind of think they're positioned right now what would you be building if you were still there uh obviously you did a lot of the sagemaker work um any any Reflections on that sure I you know I I look I mean different companies just need to what have the benefits and also like the restriction of needing to focus on different parts of the stack right uh when you run at AWS scale if your product doesn't bring in hundreds of millions of dollars a year uh it's a failed product it doesn't actually move the needle at all right startups operate in a different mode and so on and you know your horizon for Innovation and your appetite for risk is different and so on so you know I don't know that Amazon Frank L Google or Microsoft are even working on the things that you know we're working on uh I can tell you that we are laser focused on stuff that we know for a fact is going to be a part of the stack and a part of the solution uh and is realistically going to hit the market in at least you know a year and a half or two from now because it's that early right in the same way that you know five years ago we people know didn't know what the hell we were saying when we said Victor dat bases you know we are now already working on the stuff that's going to hit the market in two or three years from now so that that's that's that's the most exciting thing for me to be honest I me this is where like the really cool stuff is uh kind of happens behind the scenes yeah one thing that I think is interesting especially around you know how company how far in advance companies and infrastructure companies like you guys need to plan is you know being able to skate to where the puck Puck is going and you know kind of predict the future in in some extent especially in a market that is moving so fast where infrastructure is changing really really quickly and context windows are changing what the models can do are changing Are there specific kind of Technologies or architectures or or maybe even companies that you're watching and you're like okay that is going to be a really big thing in one year or in two years um or anything like that that's on your radar I think there's going to be a significant ific an shift in the kinds of Hardware that we use right what is happening now with gpus I think is not sustainable and it might still go up before it goes down but I don't think this is uh what AI will look like going forward right so that's that's on on Hardware we're going to have to see some something change there um and do you think that means more CPU workloads or people adapting models to run on CPUs or or maybe it's something else it's um it's going to be CPUs and gpus and maybe specialized uh you know spec servers that are really optimize for either training or surveying or maybe distributed infrastructure for that you know I'm I'm sure Vector that Bas is are going to pay a play a part in that but it's it's not it's not even I'm not even suggesting that right now it's really just there has to be a change just like microeconomic just doesn't make sense what's happening now in terms of data pipelines and and kind of data management and and so on again something's going to have to change it's it's the tools that we had 5 10 years ago just don't cut it anymore uh and both the operational headache and the actual costs and the time they have to wait and so on are just not reasonable something's going to have to change there um and again finally I I think we're going to have to start seeing those moderating systems where they even if you don't own the model or whatever like you have to somehow be able to have some kind of governance and and visibility and ability to control what's happening with your stack that today runs open loop for for most companies so we're going to see I think meaningful changes in the stack and in the in the software we use for it I'm too intrigued by what you said earlier about things you're working on that you know will will blow our minds in two three years all right I don't know if we're allowed to ask but I'll ask anyway any hints you can give us on some of the research directions or or where things are going in in your world I wish I had to I had to shamelessly uh you know give it a go we'll we'll we'll have to just reschedule you for 18 months from now so you can uh you can announce it with us I promise I promise uh to share we can be the VCS that uh that then are saying wow you actually said you actually did exactly what do exactly um well you know we always like to end our conversations with a quick fire around where we get your thoughts on on a set of common questions we ask folks and so maybe to kick it off would love your thoughts on one thing that's overhyped and one thing that's underhyped uh in AI today it's going to sound nuts but I think foundational model models are overhyped we know exactly what they can and cannot do and I don't think we're actually making a lot of progress there to be honest for quite a long time not any qualitative progress I mean not any significant progress you know I I don't know if it's underhyped but I find the code generation and and coding assistance to be exceedingly useful it's one of probably the most uh exciting use cases of this technology so underhyped what's been the biggest surprise in building pine cone maybe something that you thought would work but didn't or something that you didn't think was going to work that that ended up working really well we had a at some point pretty early I mean not very early on maybe a year and a half into the company maybe two I might be off but what up a year and a half or two into the life of the company we had a complete rewrite of the entire database in Rust everything from like we had C and python go and control plan and this that like a million different things and we just we just rewrote everything in Rust uh because we figured like the kind of operational issues that we were running into were not going to be we're not going to be able to scale with them I thought that was like borderline suicide and it would take us six months to even like get to the point where we can even you know be on par with our existing system and at that point we'll be far behind then our CTO Ram Shara was you know I'm going to we're going to we're going to complete this turn around in like a month we're like no way and uh I was shocked it didn't take a month it took it took you know two three months but you know the result was so much better than than what we had before that again like rewrites I don't know if like anybody here whatever rewrites are always like uh like whatever this is like companies literally die because of rewrites this was like a huge bit uh and oftentimes they just give you fresh and exciting new problems often times worse than the ones you started with this was one of those like as advertised freites it actually did what we were supposed to do and I was just like holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] it actually worked that's awesome um I guess besides pine cone what other company do you think would be most interesting to build uh AI features at right now I would probably go build like uh whatever join either research lab or high performance optimization like company that really does sort of like uh compiling for for these models I think the the fact that the execution layer and the training the software for training and execution is one and the same is sort of like insane um so I think there's there's a lot of fun engineering and science problems to be solved there when do you think we'll have agents that really work don't they work already I mean to the point where I can say hey AI agent book me a trip or U something like that it I don't know it seems like they sometimes work but sometimes not so much well I have human assistants that they they don't work all the time either yeah I'm not I'm not sure where you set the bar on on how often they need to work as much as like we expect from humans to work they're already doing a decent job I mean is it kind of I I will say that when they make a mistake it's more embarrassing like it's more like it's it's silly because it's not a mistake a human would make uh but I think just like probability of completing the task I think we're getting close to human levels awesome well I feel like there's a ton of threads in this conversation that folks will want to turn on it's been a fascinating discussion I'll leave the word to you like where can folks go to learn more about you about pine cone uh feel free to to point folks in any direction you want um look our website is always a good place to start uh there's plenty of material on how to build stuff examples docks notebooks like uh you know reference architectures Integrations with partners and so on yeah I mean it's always a good place to start I I I will you know as as a meta recommendation I would say don't don't try to learn about pine cone try to go build something exciting and if that leads you to needing pine cone great and if it doesn't great you still have you know build something else that was exciting nonetheless right but I think like going back to the kind of somewhere in the middle of our conversation the most common mode of failure is doing nothing uh and and you know if if you can overcome that you've already like outdone most most of the field right then you just have to make sure you don't do the cost estimate incorrectly right yes correctly and then if you think you're going to pay Pine on too much uh drop us a line and we'll come talk to you amazing well you know this has been a ton of fun seriously thank you so much for coming on my pleasure guys well Pat that was a that was a fun one yeah super fun he's he's a really interesting guest very thoughtful and you know he kind of has this lens at the infrastructure level but then they see so much by virtue of everyone building on top of pine cone so it was uh it was cool to to hear his perspective yeah I me what an interesting seat I feel like he really does see everything right he sees like the developers messing around with new applications he sees the really sophisticated Enterprises and what's required for them to get rag live uh I feel like it's a pretty cool uh cool position to have yeah and he's even more bullish on the applications and infrastructure which I thought was funny yeah I thought that was that was that was interesting um and I loved the uh the subtle JB at at VC's who you know uh poo pooed vetro databases and then came back in 2023 saying they had years of conviction nothing nothing we would ever do obviously yeah of course not us but you know the other VCS you know one thing that's just so interesting about the space as a whole is I feel like we've seen folks you know pitching oh we have this sophisticated embeddings model that works really well in this context or this retrieval approach and you know it's very clear that we're still in such the early Innings where it's just like folks are just trying to find ways to make things work the basics work and then you know and I mean too's Point like you really you just got to start building right and I think if you can make the basics work I I do wonder when we'll move to the chapter of maybe more sophisticated trade-offs and decisions around some of these uh you know embeddings models and approaches to retrieval but it certainly seems like you know it was interesting to hear him reiterate or reaffirm that uh that yeah the case today is basically just can can you get something up and running and uh he just you know it's clearly he's Blown Away by the stuff that that folks have been able to get up and running he's obviously biased given where he sits as the CEO of DB company but he definitely believes that more of the intelligence will move towards the retrieval and you know towards that part of the stack versus purely at the kind of generation and Andor model stage I loved his like cynicism of like what a surprise the people that charge per token have increased the context window you know I think he's the first person we' ever had on that says Foundation models were overhyped um you know I don't know if he's not a scaling laws believer or or or whatnot but it's always fun to uh to to you know to to get a I mean that's I think what's so fun about the space is there's just you know there's so many every time we do overhype under hype there's like a different set of things um whereas you know uh as you know I run a healthcare podcast and that space is a little bit more stagnant it's like every time the same things that are that are over and underhyped yeah I I liked his underhyped answer too of of coding assistant and there's obviously a ton of hype around them but I do think that is an incredible application of AI and um uh and one we're going to see a lot more of um Shout Out pool side I guess ex exactly always got to shout out the portfolio I thought it was interesting when he was talking about people not defaulting to open AI um and you know that is kind of the default now but he sees smaller models that are potentially cheaper doing just as well uh I thought I thought that was interesting um because I think that's that's not really something that we see very much where it kind of most people seem to start with open AI or you know maybe draw whatever and uh and then go from there totally I mean I think he's laser focused on the economics of of these use cases and you know if I'm being honest I think a lot of what we see today is still focus in like this exploration mode where it's like well what can you do with these models and it's like you might as well start with open AI because if you can't do it with that you're not going to be able to do it with with too much more uh maybe a smaller fune model uh but I think that you know it'll be interesting to see one thing I'm super curious to see is just will folks end up in this kind of optimization phase as they deploy this at SC scale probably but at the same time right when you're ready to optimize GT5 comes out or the next model comes out and it's like you're you're probably right back to just exploring again like what are the capabilities that you can do with these models and so I do Wonder um I'm sure we'll see plenty of cost optimization but uh this exploration phase I think is going to be continuous yeah he seemed a little bit more bearish on scale than I think some other folks in the ecosystem where we hear a lot of bigger bigger more gpus bigger models all of this and you know his take was it's not sustainable and the Pendulum may swing back towards you know CPUs and specialized hardware and potentially specialized models and smaller models and uh I thought I thought that was pretty interesting well Pat that was that was another fun one um folks should definitely stay tuned uh and like subscribe uh we are always trying to get the word out um share with a friend that you think might enjoy this and stay tuned next week for another great AI founder [Music] \"\n"

      "page_content=\"welcome to the Logan Bartlett show I am\\nyour host Logan Bartlett and what you're\\ngoing to hear on this episode is a\\nconversation I have with Emmett sheer\\nEmmett is the co-founder and former CEO\\nof twitch one of the most influential\\nTech Platforms in recent memory from its\\nhumble beginnings as a reality\\ntelevision show focused on one of his\\nfriends to the most influential online\\ncommunity that exists I came with a\\nframework for prioritizing features\\nwhich is I got out of talking to a bunch\\nof streamers and they wanted to fame\\nlove and money is this thing producing\\nmore money more fame or more love right\\nwe will prioritize resources against\\nthose is it not then it's not important\\nor we're not going to do that Emmett and\\nI take the conversation at a bunch of\\ndifferent directions about how he\\nlearned to grow as a leader and how he\\nultimately sold the business to Amazon\\nand then stayed on for another 10 years\\nafter that running the company Amazon\\nactually lets CEOs be CEOs if you want\\nto sell your company and keep running it\\nI couldn't recommend any really any big\\ntech company other than Amazon how do we\\njust make sure twitch continues to be\\nthe best place for streamers we also\\ntalk about why he thinks remote work is\\nactually bad for most tech companies\\nthere's a reason why silicon Valley's\\ntaking over you can't take that culture\\nand Transplant it into a remote work\\nenvironment and expect it to work Emmett\\nwas a part of the first y combinator\\nbatch in 2006 along with the founders of\\nReddit and Sam Altman and so we talked\\nwhat it was like in the early days of\\nworking with Paul Graham at YC he's\\ngoing to walk away from the conversation\\nwith Paul believing we are the shed we\\nare smart capable and we're going to\\ntake over the world the only thing\\nstanding between us and taking over the\\nworld is we have to go grind even harder\\nroad trips are not tours of gas stations\\nand your life shouldn't be a tour of\\nmoney picking finally Emmett shares what\\nhe's most concerned about with\\nartificial intelligence so here's now\\nEmma\\nthanks for doing this\\num you had four co-founders of twitch\\nJustin TV uh you stayed on ran twitch\\nMichael has been running various aspects\\nof YC over the years uh Kyle started\\nCruise after he left\\nand then Justin\\nKhan is a quasi internet celebrity at\\nthis point I mean he's gone through a\\nbunch of stuff but yeah he had Atrium he\\nhad exact Atrium and now yeah now I\\nthink internet celebrity and uh DJ DJ\\ngot it interesting guy uh what made your\\nrelationships to their co-founders such\\nthat you guys all stayed together and\\nworked well together over the years so\\nuh I've known Justin since I was eight\\nuh we grew up together in Seattle went\\nto school together uh school being a\\nhigh school elementary school uh Middle\\nSchool who she didn't go to the same\\nhigh school but then we did go to the\\nsame College again\\num and I met we met Michael uh in\\ncollege probably closer to Justin than\\nto me uh and then Kyle we recruited out\\nof MIT uh as we were starting the\\ncompany he was a uh he was a I think a\\nsophomore at the time\\nhow did you come across Kyle well he\\nsays an email to the MIT like hackers\\nwho want projects list and two people\\nreplied and one of them was Kyle\\num and uh\\nhe thought we seemed incredible because\\nwe built a startup and sold it on eBay\\nbefore and we thought he seemed credible\\nbecause he sent us a 27-page PDF with\\nCAD drawings and so we uh uh we wound up\\nwe want to pick him up selling a startup\\non eBay by the way we glossed over that\\nbut uh you literally listed the IP for\\nyour company on eBay which is an\\ninteresting separate story you've told\\nit you've told him enough I won't make\\nit again but I can tell the short\\nversion of it which is that we'd started\\na copy of Google Calendar but before\\nGoogle Calendar existed and after Google\\nlaunched Google Calendar we were like oh\\nwe didn't really have any other ideas\\nfor what to do other than a JavaScript\\ncalendar on the internet and they\\nalready did that so uh we decided we'd\\nsell it uh\\nwe didn't know how to sell something on\\nthe Internet like how to sell us a\\nsoftware company uh especially one that\\nwasn't like a real acquisition and so we\\nthought we just listed on eBay uh which\\nwhich worked actually we sold like a\\nquarter million dollars\\num which\\num I think it's actually a good\\ndemonstration of like the kind of thing\\nyou have to do in startups a lot which\\nis\\nyou you have to just figure out how to\\nsolve a problem uh\\neven if the standard paths don't that\\nyou have to make up what what it is\\num there's a lot of making it up uh that\\nhas to happen first first thing like\\nstartup because almost by definition the\\nnormal stuff isn't isn't all set up was\\nthat a PR did you know it was going to\\nbe kind of PR stunty and that that would\\nlead to distribution yeah that was that\\nwas the idea that was part of it the\\nidea was we were like we need to get\\npeople to know we're selling it how do\\nwe reach them oh if we listed on eBay\\nthat'll be funny we can get people to\\nwrite an article about that it was very\\nintentional it actually worked it worked\\nthat's how it worked it worked it worked\\nas planned actually yeah minus the fact\\nthat eBay took down our listing is we\\nhad two links in it\\num about five days into the seven day\\nlisting and we had to relist it which is\\nkind of a hard stopping experience\\nbecause we had one bit at fifty thousand\\ndollars at that point and we were like\\nno we've lost our bidder uh but it turns\\nout that uh that that didn't actually\\nhurt us at all so you had the\\ncredibility of that and so Kyle was like\\nthese guys have credibility yeah they\\nthey must know what they're doing I I\\nthink Kyle overestimated how much\\ncredibility that should have given us\\nbut uh it did it did prove that we were\\nthe kind of people who like could\\nactually build things um and sell them\\nso that's I guess it wasn't a zero and\\nthere was a deep level of trust but also\\nsome dysfunction among the group Kyle\\nwent nocturnal for a while to avoid\\nconflicts so yeah there's actually we\\ndid a podcast about this uh an only\\nfriends episode which is great it's\\nsuper entertaining two hours of like you\\nguys shooting the yeah if you want\\nthe the full full deep details version\\nof it but the high level version is uh\\nlike it worked because all four of us\\ntrusted each other\\num and we somehow managed to pick four\\npeople who were smart hard-working you\\nknow competent but I think most of all\\nwho had the\\nwho understood what it meant to be part\\nof a Wii not not a bunch of individuals\\nalways thinking about whether or not uh\\nhow is this working for me\\num and I think that that's what makes\\nuh that's what makes Partnerships work\\num\\nboth probably like romantic Partnerships\\nand business Partnerships because if\\nyou're going to be in a a partnership\\nnot an employer employee relationship\\nbut a partnership relationship you can't\\nalways be thinking about whether or not\\nor you can't be modeling what what are\\nthey doing are they are they trying to\\nwhat what's their incentive versus my\\nincentive versus the company's incentive\\nit's dramatically simplifying it makes\\neverything a lot easier if you can just\\nonly think about what is right for the\\ncompany and then just ignore everything\\nelse\\num\\nand I think that that's something that\\ngoes wrong in a lot of uh a lot of\\nthings and it's it's what causes\\ninstability because suddenly\\nwhen there's lots of interest at stake\\nthere is conflict about my interest\\nversus your interest but when you can\\nsimplify it to well what is our interest\\nand everyone everyone can actually\\ncommit to that uh it works pretty well\\nis there any way to solve for that as\\nyou're now working more with\\nentrepreneurs\\num yeah be that way yourself yeah like\\nthe number one the number one cause of\\nthe problem in all of your relationships\\nis you that's true again romantically\\nand in business uh and\\nthe solvings for how do I\\nactually buy into this is this is we we\\nare doing this is really important and\\nthen also obviously you need to work\\nwith people who have that mindset as\\nwell but you have less control over that\\nand you have less ability to detect it\\nand at some level you know you have to\\ntrust and Hope\\nbut uh I think there's something about\\nif if you do it\\nfirst of all you can control that so\\nthat's good but second of all\\nit brings it out of other people when\\nthey when they can see that you're\\nserious about we and you're not\\nyou're not run you're not gaming them\\nyou're not cheating uh you're not like\\npretending you're about all about we and\\nthen actually being about yourself\\npeople respond to that it draws it out\\nof your partner as well so you launched\\nand shipped a bunch of products over the\\nyears uh that ultimately led to Twitch\\nso there was a calendar for gmail which\\nwas you and Justin then after that\\nsocial network for families SoundCloud\\nlike business a web crawler that map\\npopularity like clout a flexible to-do\\nlist kind of an airtable-ish thing an\\nEvite competitor something that was kind\\nof similar to GitHub her Roku replet\\nwhatever you want to call it then Justin\\nTV ultimately twitch I heard you say\\nsomething interesting when learning you\\nget exposure to a wide variety of\\nproblems related to the topic to\\nactually teach you how to understand and\\nsee the differences between things you\\ndon't just study one piece of music to\\nlearn music did all these experiments\\nand all the different products that you\\nguys iterated on did it actually help\\nprepare you for twitch's success or are\\nthey just aimless Cycles along the way\\num I think did help prepare us I think\\nthe main thing they actually prepared me\\nfor was building like I did learn\\nsomething from the product work on it\\nbut honestly we did such a bad job on\\nthe product\\nuh design aspects of it and the sort of\\nbusiness design aspects of it that I\\ndidn't learn as much from that as I'd\\nlike to what I what we learned from is\\nthe engineering side of it like the\\ndesign side of it like how do you\\nactually build a thing that like\\nfunctions and and has uh has\\nfunctionality and not too many bugs and\\nI got a ton out of stuff on the uh\\nuh on the building side I would say on\\nthe on the how does stuff work side and\\nlearning how to design how to how to\\nbuild a product how to build a\\nsuccessful business\\num the stuff I built myself was probably\\nonly\\na tenth of the data mostly I was like\\nobsessively studying how other\\nbusinesses worked because you get a lot\\nmore you can only launch a new thing\\nevery you know few weeks if you're fast\\nusually every few months like a\\nsignificant new thing but there's new\\nstuff being launched all the time and if\\nyou want the number of reps you need you\\ncan't just learn from your own your own\\nmistakes you have to be learning from\\neveryone else's mistakes and everyone\\nelse's successes at the same time I\\nthink that's the uh that was my\\nyou know my primary uh you know\\nUniversity for that was it what was with\\nJustin with Michael with Kyle every\\nlunch every night every weekend like we\\njust talked about startups Non-Stop and\\nthe thing we would often be talking\\nabout would be not our startup but like\\noh why is you know Facebook is working\\nwhy is Facebook working why are they\\nbeating Myspace like what's different\\nabout it why what's good about their\\nstrategy what's not good about their\\nstrategy\\num\\nand that\\nand really carefully paying attention\\nand trying out and like using the\\nproduct and and\\npaying attention to what is actually\\nworking in the real world you learn a\\nlot I think that's where that's probably\\nthe main thing I learned from from a\\ndesign point of view I I I joke that\\nthat's my main only value as a career\\nFinance person investor is one I'm used\\nto just giving advice and letting people\\ndecide you know I'm not used to having\\nactually owning the decision myself\\nwhich is actually can be nice as a board\\nmember like hey here are the options and\\ntwo you get to simulate out a lot of\\ndifferent data points for all the\\ncompanies that come in and pitch and so\\nyou're you can extrapolate on a bunch of\\ndifferent stuff there\\none of the things that uh I have a\\nfriend uh Matt who uh almost started our\\nfirst company with us but instead went\\ninto went into finance and you know runs\\na hedge fund and uh\\nuh has worked at a bunch of the finance\\njobs over the years uh and he's he's an\\ninvestor in what I've discovered is\\ninvestors have this\\njust in totally different lens at least\\nyou know public markets investors and I\\nthink most private markets investors as\\nwell who are a later stage where it's\\nabout like whether the industry is good\\nand like the capital allocation like the\\nstructure of the business which is not\\nsomething actually that Founders think\\nabout all that much and I think I think\\nit's right that Founders don't think\\nabout that because For the First\\ntwo three years of a company\\nit doesn't matter like just build\\nsomething people want and sell it to\\nthem like ignore everything else but as\\nyou get bigger and bigger those things\\nbecome actually quite important and you\\nstart to try to think about oh or in\\nthis industry but we could be in this\\nadjacent industry and there's some way\\nto shift how our business is perceived\\nor what kind of work we do and how\\nwhat's the structure of how Capital\\nflows work and can we change that and\\nthose actually do become very important\\nquestions but like usually later\\num there's sort of a handoff that\\nhappens it's funny to hear you all talk\\nabout like iterating on the product and\\ntrying to find something and one of the\\nthrowaway lines I've heard I don't know\\nif is you adjusted or someone's saying\\nwe could go be build Enterprise software\\nbut that's boring and we don't want to\\ngo do that I was like you know in 2006\\nor 2007 you would have created a lot of\\nvalue doing Enterprise software and you\\nwere just like hey not for us that's too\\nboring to go pursue it um I think uh we\\nwe talked about building instead of\\ntwitch or social cam\\num because Michael went and uh founded\\nsocial cam which you end up selling to\\nAutodesk that was weird in a way the\\nAutodesk thing never really made sense\\nto me\\num\\nwe talked about building a WebEx\\ncompetitor because like WebEx is\\nobviously a huge market like\\nteleconferencing and\\nwe have like no doubt we could build a\\nbetter product than WebEx because WebEx\\nis annoying to use\\nwhich we're basically talking about Zoom\\nright a more consumer version of WebEx\\nis zoom\\num and\\nwe decided against it because we knew it\\nwould involve Enterprise no not the\\nproduct side of it but the sales side of\\nit like Enterprise sales is like a whole\\nbusiness and uh\\nwe just like had no interest in like\\nlearning how to do that\\num and it's actually uh\\nI think I think a good example of sort\\nof knowing yourself like I actually\\ndon't think I would have had I think I\\nprobably could have learned how to do it\\nbut I don't think I didn't want to do\\nthat I wanted to do something else and I\\nthink it's it's important for Founders\\nto do after the thing that they're\\ninterested in\\num although\\nit was also a better time for Consumer\\nlike I think\\nuh we go twitch worked a lot of actually\\ngood consumers companies started around\\nthat time it got a lot harder to win in\\nconsumer as the big player is\\nConsolidated uh more of distribution and\\nI think\\nuh I think three or four years later\\nmaybe we would have pivoted into\\nEnterprise just because lack of any\\ncredible other option just getting\\ndistribution would have been really hard\\nwith and certainly today it's a huge\\npain um there's an hourglass quote that\\nI like a lot and I know you do as well I\\nthink I've quoted it before uh I won't\\nread the whole thing but nobody tells\\nthis to people who are beginners I wish\\nsomeone told me all of us who do\\ncreative work we get into it because we\\nhave good taste but there is a gap for\\nthe first couple years you bake stuff\\nit's not that good it's trying to be\\ngood it has potential but it's not but\\nyour taste the thing that got you to the\\ngame is still killer and your taste is\\nwhy your work disappoints you a lot of\\npeople never get past this phase they\\nquit most people I know who do interest\\nin Creative work went through years of\\nthis we know our work doesn't have the\\nspecial thing that we wanted to have we\\nall go through this and if you are just\\nstarting out or you are in this phase\\nyou got to know it's normal and the most\\nimportant thing you can do is put in the\\nwork\\nperiod it's a sort of profound quote I\\nthink it can be applied to a lot of\\ndifferent things as you guys were\\niterating on all of it did you did you\\nknow that your products just weren't\\nthat good and was it disappointing along\\nthe way to ship all these different\\nthings and not have it take off like you\\nhoped it would yeah I'd say there's I\\nhad that in three different layers I'm\\nthe first one from an engineering\\nperspective I just wasn't that good of\\nan engineer I knew what good engineering\\nlooked like I remember visiting for the\\nfriend feed offices which had like\\nGmail incredible programmer I think who\\nelse is maybe Brett Taylor like like\\nreally\\ninsanely good programmers and them\\ntalking about their Engineering Process\\nand like me using their product and\\nseeing the engineering behind it just\\nbeing like\\noh that's what that's what I'm trying to\\ndo that and like the thing I'm just like\\nincompetent like the thing I'm doing I'm\\njust doing this all wrong\\num and then spending like 10 years\\ntrying to get better at building stuff\\nand eventually I I did learn how to\\nbuild stuff more like the way that they\\ndid\\num and it was better but it was it was\\n10 years of like being quite\\ndisappointed in the quality of the\\nengineering I was doing\\nit was it worked but it it wasn't like\\nuh it wasn't\\nwell designed it wasn't good\\num\\nand then there was this the product side\\nwhere\\num\\nI I did I didn't think I didn't\\nI wasn't that disappointed in the the\\nMicro Design of the products I just\\nthought we did a pretty good job there\\nfrom fairly early and to some degree\\nit's a\\nuh\\nit's a little different from uh from\\nother kinds of creation things sort of\\nlike whatever you can think of you can\\nkind of do like copying is very easy at\\nthat level and so if you have good taste\\nyou can just copy good stuff and it\\nworks but at the macro level there's\\nthis thing missing where like\\nwe weren't good at business well we\\nweren't good at figuring out what do we\\nneed to build that people will actually\\nwant and the constant disappointment was\\nwe'd build stuff and I wouldn't have\\nactually solved the problem for the\\nperson I think\\nand that was very frustrating and like\\nhard to uh hard to deal with and\\nuh there was a sense of like\\nuh\\nthat that's that's almost more like\\nlearning to do science\\nI would say the engineering thing is the\\nthing where I felt The Hourglass quote\\nthe strongest\\nthe\\nand about like I had this level of taste\\nwhere I could really see what I was\\ntrying to do and I couldn't achieve it\\nwith my hands the other thing was not\\nunderstanding like\\nuh it's like I was I was I was a grad\\nstudent I was writing papers and they\\nwere getting published but I knew I\\nwasn't actually like discovering\\nanything that's that important like the\\nthe papers which weren't on important\\ndiscoveries and I was somehow missing I\\nknew I was missing something\\num\\nbut that's a that's a slightly different\\nthing Than The Hourglass question\\nJustin TV so you the original idea for\\nit for people that don't remember was\\nactually\\nfollowing Justin your co-founder around\\nfor 24 hours a day filming 100 of his\\nlife\\ndid you did you actually think at that\\ntime that like that you would be a\\nreality television Studio business or\\ndid you know this was kind of a means to\\nsome end and you were mucking around the\\nidea was always that we would\\nopen it up for other people to produce\\nshows like we never thought we were\\ngoing to be the people\\nfor doing the production everything\\nwe're going to license the MTV or\\nwhatever yeah we we thought we were\\nprodu building a technology to enable\\nourselves to make the first\\nlive streaming reality show and that\\nother people would then go on to build\\nmake more live streaming reality shows\\nusing using what we built which you know\\nwithin one order of magnitude is what\\nwhat happened\\num but where we got what went wrong was\\nthat uh\\nuh with that Vision was that like\\nreality TV requires editing live reality\\nTV is a bad idea\\nI just didn't really understand how the\\nentertainment I didn't understand we\\ndidn't understand anything about\\nanything so that that was that was crazy\\nbut actually to level below that we were\\nvery very right because we what we\\nactually had was that Justin\\nuh who\\nuh has always been you know living in\\nthe future a little bit when it comes to\\nthis kind of stuff\\nuh really wanted to be an influencer and\\nreally wanted the attention and wanted\\nthought it would be cool to like live\\nstream a lot about of of his life which\\nwas a thing that not a lot of people had\\ndone at that point and we built the\\ntechnology to enable him to live his\\ninfluencer dreams and that turned out to\\nbe quite powerful actually\\num the number one thing we did right\\nwith Justin TV the thing I would\\nencourage everyone who's trainable\\nconsumer software to do is we built\\nsomething for ourselves we built the\\nthing that we wanted to use every day or\\nat least one person on our team wanted\\nto use every day and uh most of the\\nInnovations\\non Twitch on Justin TV were things we\\ninvented for ourselves running the show\\nbecause we thought they'd be fun like\\nthe idea of having uh our own custom\\nemotes and chat that are like faces of\\nthe people on the show that twitch\\ndistilled does that today uh\\nand we had that idea because we were\\nrunning the show we would never have\\ncome up with it in a vacuum and so I\\nthink there's something really powerful\\nabout that approach even though we were\\nwe were wrong about the reality TV show\\nthing we were right about\\npeople wanting to do live streaming I\\nmean twitch was ultimately a version of\\njust Justin TV it was just more uh\\nverticalized or specialized do you think\\nhad you kept that Justin TV I guess why\\ndidn't you guys keep at Justin TV why\\ndidn't you keep plowing ahead we we got\\nJustin TV profitable after the 2008\\nfinancial crisis uh I've spent about a\\nyear you know cutting costs generating\\nRevenue just iteratively focused on\\nmoney and you had a Doomsday Clock\\nactually on the wall yeah is that\\nsomething you would recommend to people\\nit wasn't on the wall it was every every\\nFriday we would sit down with the\\nemployees and be like we've got we've\\ngot you know 14 months we've got 11\\nmonths we've got I think at the worst\\ncase it was like we were down to like\\nnine weeks\\num\\nit was certainly clarifying I think uh I\\nonly recommend it if you can convince\\npeople on the team that we can't succeed\\notherwise people will start\\nuh packing their bags and looking\\nelsewhere pretty fatalistic um but I\\nthink I think\\nthe founding team never showed any\\nindication nor ever had any indication\\nor belief that we weren't going to\\nfigure it out we were we were very sure\\nand also we we started sharing We Didn't\\nStart sharing it when there's like two\\nmonths left we started sharing it quite\\nfar in advance\\num\\nand everyone could see that while the\\nClock Was ticking down the rate was\\ngetting better and we were making\\nprogress and so it felt like oh yeah\\nyeah\\nwe are pulling the plane out of the dive\\nit might be a close thing but like they\\ncould people could see that we were\\ngoing to get there so was the pursuit of\\nprofitability ultimately at the expense\\nof Justin TV's success as a standalone\\noh it was it was at the expense of our\\ngrowth uh\\nand then we had this thing that wasn't\\ngrowing we're trying to decide I was\\nprofitable but I'm not growing and we're\\ntrying to decide okay what do we do from\\nhere\\nand\\nuh\\nno one thought just pursuing Justin's we\\nhad no good ideas for ideas for what to\\ndo to like\\nreinvigorate growth of Justin TV per se\\nand so we had you know Michael they did\\na pivot into so much you built some\\nmobile video stuff which in an era\\nbefore before Snapchat and before Tick\\nTock pretty good Insight yeah\\num\\nI like Autodesk didn't seem to execute\\non the uh the vision of the consumer\\nvideo yeah we didn't quite get there but\\nbut like but there was a there was a\\nthere for sure\\num\\nand uh I want to do the video game thing\\nbecause I was watching video games on uh\\non Justin TV and enjoying it\\num but the big pivot from Justin TV to\\nTwitch like the real difference between\\nthe two companies is not the gaming\\nversus the uh general purpose thing\\nthat's a superficial change\\num and it motivated me to focus on a set\\nof customers\\num\\nbut I think we could have in retrospect\\nI know why we did the Rebrand and like\\nbut we actually had a debate at the time\\nwhether we needed to do the redrands I\\nthink we probably would have been\\nsuccessful without it I think the\\nRebrand was helpful and it was\\nuh it made more sense like that uh for\\nthe uh for the company and so it's\\nprobably like you know a good idea I\\nwould do it again but not strictly\\nnecessary would have found some amount\\nof a similar level of success regardless\\nand uh\\nno but the big change the big change was\\nwas\\nI realized that the important customer\\nfor live was the streamer not the viewer\\nthat\\nthat ultimately for live video unlike\\nfor uh for YouTube\\num we we could not say well whatever the\\ncreators will deal with it what matters\\nto the audience they're just here for an\\naudience\\nthey weren't really there for the\\naudience the the audience was there for\\nthem and you have to keep winning the\\nstreamer's business every day because if\\nyou don't they're gonna go stream\\nsomewhere else and now\\nthere's no library of content like there\\nis for the uh for something like YouTube\\nand so\\nyou can't just have people show up\\ncreate a little bit and leave that like\\nthat doesn't work you need people\\ncreating all the time and so the focus\\nhad to be how do we build something\\ngreat for streamers\\num and that's why we invented paying\\nstreamers money that's why we like I\\nwent and interviewed a bunch of\\nstreamers and figured out here's what\\nstreamers need\\num and that was a that was a much bigger\\nshift than the gaming part was\\nbuilding a product that was designed for\\nstreamers first and foremost was the\\ngaming thing in intuition on your part I\\nmean you obviously enjoyed watching it\\nuh or was there I guess as you reach\\nthese conclusions gaming and focusing on\\nstreamers and not the viewers was there\\ndata that backed that up or was it just\\nan intuition thing that you kind of\\nrealized the gaming thing was purely\\nintuition I mean you could point at data\\nlike there are a lot of Gamers if I was\\nto do a McKinsey market research thing I\\ncould be like Oh look The size gaming\\nindustry is very large that's more\\nincreasingly spending more time on the\\ninternet bessemer's memo is uh public\\nfrom their investment so you can go look\\nat all their Market sizing stuff I\\nactually went back and I found my the\\nemail I wrote that's like it's like uh\\ntwo paragraphs long like a like a half\\npage email that's like here's why gaming\\nmakes sense and it's basically it's the\\nvery abbreviated version of that\\nargument\\num advertisers like gaming you know like\\nthe game companies interest are aligned\\nwith ours so the copyright stuff like I\\nthought about that but the idea was\\npurely intuition I really like this I\\nbet I'm not that much of a weirdo like I\\nI like popular media if I like watching\\nthis it's likely to also be a popular\\nmedia\\num\\nthe part that was more data backed was\\nthe streamer part\\num\\nI went and looked and found that there\\nwere about 200 people making gaming\\ncontent and\\nwho had any audience at all and I was\\nlike oh if we get\\nyou know if we can convince 180 of those\\npeople to stream on Twitch\\nwe just win like there's just there's\\njust no it's just unambiguous there's no\\nway we can lose actually\\num and so we just pivoted the company to\\nbe fully focused on that and that I\\nthink was reasonably data driven in the\\nsense that\\nI went and like looked at I looked at to\\njust make the decision about viewer\\nversus streamer I went and actually got\\ndata and then thought about it um\\nalthough\\nit was certainly informed by having\\nworked in the space for five years and\\nlike having the intuition to sort of\\nunderstand the dynamic of\\nuh what it would mean to win a streamer\\nand so the band kind of broke up at that\\npoint Michael went with social cam\\nJustin left the company around then and\\nKyle ran the legacy of what was Justin\\nTV for a while yeah so we uh we actually\\nweren't sure whether we wanted to do the\\nsocial cam idea or the gaming idea\\ninstead of debate it we were like we're\\ngonna fund the gaming idea and the\\nmobile idea is like Skunk Works projects\\nand then we're gonna set goals and if\\nthey hit the goals we will pivot to them\\nit was just jamming more ads on Justin\\nTV to pay for this we are our jamming\\nwords TV that was that was already the\\npre-roll mid-roll banner that was\\nalready the plan yeah the plan was\\nalready to extract like we were already\\nin the we were\\nJustin TV plan unchanged extract maximum\\nprofit\\num\\nwe then but yeah that meant we were\\nprofitable which we could fund like\\nthese projects\\num and twitch we hit our goals we hit\\nlike the we hit like I said like a 25\\ngrowth a month goal and we were hit like\\na 30 growth a month which is great\\num and how did you go about actually\\ndoing that was that the work with the\\nstreamers yeah it was just it was the\\nthe\\nexact process I was talking about of\\nlike oh there's 200 streamers let's call\\nthem\\nwhat does it take to convince them I'm\\nsorry Kevin was one of the very first\\npeople who I think he was the first\\nperson I brought on to my my gaming team\\nhe was my the first time I was like I\\nneed Kevin I was like Kevin uh was our\\nhe was basically all the non-programming\\nengineering stuff originally\\num and I was like Kevin\\nyour mission is to convince people they\\nneed to stream gaming on Justin TV like\\ngo talk to them and get them to do it um\\nand Kevin is probably one of the single\\nbest beauty people I've ever worked with\\nand uh he did a very good job of doing\\nthat and like I backed him up with he\\nwould be like Oh They'll switch if we\\nbuild this and I'm like great on it and\\nthen we just go build\\nthe thing\\num\\nMichael had took two engineers and built\\nuh and Justin kind of uh started working\\nmostly on that project with Michael\\nbuilding uh social cam\\nwe didn't actually hit the social cam\\ngoals it took them longer to build\\nTwitch uh the Justin TV gaming was like\\nliterally just built on Justin TV gaming\\nlike we didn't have to build a new\\nproduct\\nwe turned out we overestimated how fast\\nit was it would be to build\\nuh an entirely new product from scratch\\nfor mobile gaming so that they didn't\\nhit the growth goals but we felt like\\nthe product they built was promising\\nenough that it was worth doing the\\neffort to spin it off and be retrospect\\nwe were right about that too so we spun\\nthat off\\num Michael went with it uh Justin hung\\naround for a few months but like I think\\nyou know\\nwas also feeling the issue something\\nelse and I think wasn't it it's funny\\nJustin now like loves twitching like\\nwith learned what the product was I\\nthink at the time didn't really\\nunderstand or love the gaming streaming\\nproduct and so he was like didn't want\\nto work on it that much which totally\\nmakes sense to me um and then Kyle uh\\nwas figuring out what to do graciously\\nran the Legacy business for me for like\\nuh more than a year I think and then\\nfound uh Colin carrier who was our uh\\nwho was the his replacement\\num to run it uh which was amazing\\nbecause like that was basically funding\\nthe business so we needed someone good\\nrunning it\\num and then he went off to start Cruise\\nI heard you say that people come for the\\nentertainment but stay for the\\nrelationships within the community what\\nwhen did you realize there was something\\nunique going on from a community\\nstandpoint yeah come for the video stay\\nfor the chat so\\nuh when I first started building twitch\\nI was using myself as the Prototype\\nviewer and I am the type of viewer we've\\ncome to call a strat the strategist\\nwhich means I was there because I liked\\nwatching people who are good at the\\ngames that I like to play so I could\\nlearn from them ask them questions stuff\\nlike that almost like a group coaching\\nsession\\num\\nor I could watch Esports and like like\\nlive uh Esports entertainment and that\\nwas also that was also uh great for me\\num\\nit turned out very rapidly though that I\\nwas in the minority strategists make up\\nabout 20 percent\\nof twitch viewers\\n80 of people were there because they\\nlike they liked the hanging out they\\nliked the connection they got from\\nhanging out with other people in chat\\nand\\ntalking to people looking you know\\nwatching them it was just rapidly\\nobvious oh I'm I'm actually not the\\nPrototype here these other people are\\nthe Prototype is that are those the two\\ngroups yeah you can you can you actually\\ncan subdivide the community group more\\nfinely so we have more second Graphics\\nunderneath that but they're at the top\\nlevel there's like are you there for the\\nentertainment or are you and then\\nlearning or are you there for the\\nentertainment and then Community\\num\\nand then there's you can you can go\\ndeeper I'm curious like are there any\\nbroad Strokes of the other types of\\npeople it's it comes down to like are\\nyou do you\\nare you about uh the personality more or\\nare you about uh the chat Vibe more like\\nwhat's the what's the part of being here\\nthat's the most important thing but like\\nit's a little inside baseball and\\nfundamentally not that important because\\nthey all benefit from the same like it\\nyou don't actually build different\\nproducts for different people yeah so it\\ndoesn't you know it's at some level it\\ndoesn't really matter\\num whereas the the learning versus\\nCommunity thing is a really important uh\\nproduct impacting Insight\\num and so that's when we sort of\\nrealized like oh people are there for\\nthe connection okay that's the like real\\nthat's the thing they stick around for\\nmost of our users stick around for\\num and so\\nthat was uh that was a pretty deliberate\\nuh learning from looking at our users\\nlike it wasn't we didn't just make it up\\nwere there non-obvious things that you\\ndid to cultivate the community or\\nultimately what is building the product\\nfor the streamer then it became obvious\\nthat they would cultivate it yeah no I\\nthink that that was the that was the\\nlearning from focus on the streamer was\\nlike very very early it's obvious if our\\ncustomer is the streamer then our job is\\nto help them cultivate their Community I\\nstill believe that to be true I don't\\nthink twitch has communities doesn't\\nhave any Community Church has streamers\\nstreamers have communities and when\\npeople get confused and think that oh\\nthe community people on Twitch care\\nabout twitch they don't care about\\ntwitch they care about the streamer and\\nour job is to\\nfacilitate that\\num and it's very egoic I think it's like\\nyou get you're like you're telling the\\nstory that you're the hero the streamer\\nis the hero our job is to like with the\\none of the slogan we came up with for it\\nlater was we play support\\nlike the streamer is the carry we are\\nsupport\\num and I think that's uh\\nthat's a key like mental model for a\\nproduct like twitch\\ntwitch was able to uniquely beat back\\ncompetition from a bunch of uh heavily\\nfunded tech companies along the way I\\nguess what was the feeling Google had a\\nfamous tweet welcome player two uh when\\nthey when they announced their presence\\nwhere were you when that happened what\\nwas the sentiment around that yeah so\\nafter we were acquired by Amazon I think\\neveryone else who was like oh maybe\\nwe'll acquire twitch it's like oh we're\\nnot gonna acquire twitch okay uh we\\nbetter launch competitors and So within\\nlike less than a year Microsoft\\nGoogle YouTube and Facebook had all\\nlaunched\\nvery explicit like twitch competitors\\nand started spending huge amounts of\\nmoney bidding on streamers\\num in a very non-sustainable way that\\nwasn't that was trying to them trying to\\nbuy a critical mass\\num of uh of audience\\nuh which was uh was exhilarating\\num I think it was good for twitch like\\ncompetition is good it's good for the\\nservice\\num yeah we we posted a kind of snarky\\ntweet they sort of Welcome player two uh\\nwhen when uh YouTube launched theirs\\num but I think that really was our\\nattitude which was like\\nif you can build a better product for\\nthe streamers you're more than welcome\\nand you should win\\num but we think our product's better and\\nwe think streamers are going to choose\\nus every time\\nand our strategy to beat everybody was\\nwe had to bid against people and stuff\\nbut like ultimately we let a lot of\\nstreamers walk like we we could have\\nkept bidding more money\\num\\nand uh we didn't outbid on everything we\\nupdated a bunch of stuff but like not\\neverything\\num and\\nour Focus was from the very first\\nbeginning how do we just make sure\\ntwitch continues to be the best place\\nfor streamers\\num and if we continue to make it so like\\nthey continue to choose us instead of\\ninstead of the competition and I've uh I\\nremember reading a bunch of some\\nstreamers complaining about to actually\\nbe like basically like oh I want to go\\nto the you know YouTube except like you\\nknow I feel like they're offering me\\nmore money but uh and I'd go except you\\nknow it's not fair like which has to be\\ntrapped because because all the\\nmoderation tools are so much better and\\nthis is bad I'm like yeah we you mean we\\ntrapped you about with our nefarious\\nplan of building a better product that\\nactually works yes I fully admit this is\\nour our secret plan the rules all along\\nyes you didn't see it coming but we\\nwould we're gonna build stuff that you\\nlike and then give it to you for free\\num yeah so that very diabolic yeah it's\\ntotally diabolical but like that was the\\nthat was the thing like we we won\\nbecause our product was better\\num and uh\\nI think that's like a and it was better\\nin the way people people cared about\\nthere's a lot of nice to have features\\num like fun things that people think\\nthey want polls is the best example I\\nthink we actually have a polls feature\\nnow for many many years we did not and\\nour competition did they had a polls\\nfeature people would complain about this\\nbut the truth is you can run a poll\\nusing like a online like there are many\\npoll things you can just use on the\\ninternet if you want to\\nif we screw up chat moderation if we\\nscrew up uh if you're if your\\nsubscriptions don't work well if\\ndiscovery isn't good\\nyou can't fix those things only we can\\nand you don't actually want us to build\\na poll you think you do but like the\\ntruth is you don't actually and when you\\nwould confront them with the actual\\nchoice would you like to make a dollar\\nmore per hour or would you like to us to\\nbuild launch polls like oh a dollar\\nobviously what are you talking about\\nlike well that's right okay we're gonna\\nkeep working another thing then how do\\nyou get to those conclusions like when\\nyou're hearing from your users I want\\nthis thing but being able to discern\\nthat they actually don't really want\\nthis thing at the expense of what it\\nwould take you to go do it and is it\\nactually framing in those terms of would\\nyou prefer an extra dollar or would you\\nprefer like more Engineers on this yeah\\nso when I got started with twitch I uh I\\ncame up with a framework for\\nprioritizing features which is I got out\\nof talking to a bunch of streamers and\\nbasically\\nuh asking them why they streamed and\\nsort of what their goals were and what\\nwhat they what they wanted out of it and\\nwe came up with was they wanted Fame\\nLove and Money\\num uh Fame they want to like obviously\\nreach an audience grow it have more\\npeople watch them get more hours of\\nvideo watch basically\\num love they wanted to feel positive\\nsocial feedback and connection for doing\\nit whether that's from twitch because\\nthey got invited to twitchcon or because\\nsome uh twitch you know partner manager\\nreached out or it's from Their audience\\nsaying how great they love the show and\\nhow amazing that was\\num and then money they wanted to make\\nmoney on the stream and basically if we\\nbuilt something and there's a secret\\nfourth thing which is like the video has\\nto work they want the live video to be\\nlike actually good enough okay cool\\nthat's us let's put that one aside\\nthat's the underpinning that's the\\nunderpinning like that's this table\\nstack that just has to work uh assume it\\ndoes\\num\\nis this thing producing more money more\\nfame or more love great like we will\\nprioritize resources against those is it\\nnot\\nthen it's not important and we're not\\ngoing to do that\\num and\\nuh that worked because those were the\\nthree most important things and then\\nonce you have that structure you can\\nkind of it's easy to compare within\\nmoney which of these things we think\\nwill be most helpful to make the most\\nmoney within discovery which of these\\nthings in Fame which of these things\\nwill help grow audiences the most\\num Love is the trickiest one obviously\\nbecause love is a little bit less it's a\\nlittle more fuzzier and less clearer\\nthan Fame and money are but uh but\\nultimately it's like having good\\nmoderation in chat\\num having uh experiences for streamers\\nwhere they feel they feel loved by by\\ntwitch and that we care about them\\nOnce Upon a Time Google came and made an\\noffer to buy Justin TV uh before it was\\nreally in the before all the twitch\\nstuff came to be and ultimately uh you\\ngot far down the acquisition process and\\nthen people on the team failed Google's\\nuh tests or something they uh Google was\\nconsidered an aqua hire and out of our\\nlike whatever I know 30\\ntotal people they like had like 10 that\\nthey thought were like Google quality\\num and made an offer on that basis and\\nwe were just like\\nno\\nuh and in retrospect I remember like\\nlooking at the offer and if they'd\\noffered us three times more money I\\nthink we would have taken it\\num\\nbut\\nuh but I'm really glad they didn't offer\\nus three times as much money um same\\nthing actually happened with Kiko on\\nYahoo Yahoo offered to buy Kiko which is\\nyour calendar with a calendar company\\nfor a million dollars in but like in\\nretention over like four years so like\\n250 000 a year in signing bonus on top\\nof a you know mid-level Yahoo engineer\\noffer and\\nI'm really glad they lowballed us\\nbecause if they hadn't live all this we\\nmight have taken it and like uh\\nuh we didn't really want to do those we\\ndidn't really want to work for Google or\\nwork for Yahoo we wanted to run the\\ncompany it's just it felt like you have\\nto take if they offered you a win you\\ncould like have to take it\\num so I'm so I'm glad they didn't are\\nthere any lessons actually from either\\nof those stories that are that you could\\nextrapolate as a as something you would\\ntell a founder or is it hey those are\\nthe funny situations and the road not\\ntraveled but at the end of the day it's\\njust there was nothing to be learned\\nfrom the individuals I don't really\\nthink I've\\nI've I've\\nthe only time I've ever used it\\nsomeone's like oh I got an acquisition\\noffer from this company\\num\\nand I talked to them and I'm like okay\\nthis is this is like an aqua hire here's\\nlike here's how it's gonna work like\\nhere's here's how Aqua hires work and\\nhaving been through one myself I kind of\\nlike I know what the what the process\\nwill be like a little bit although it\\ndoes vary from company to company it's\\nnot that variable\\num and so occasionally it's helpful for\\nadvising someone who's in the exact same\\nsituation but other than that there's\\nnot really much there's not much\\ngeneralizable from it I don't think this\\nmight be an annoying question that just\\nuh people in the media and I guess\\nVenture capitalists ask you but how much\\ntime have you given to thinking about\\ntwitch as a standalone versus within\\nAmazon I like whether we should have\\nsold it or not yeah\\num well I mean selling it uh worked out\\nreally well for us because uh\\nit was unrelated let twitch grow on its\\nown like did they help with bidding for\\nstreamers and like was that an expensive\\nCapital outlay that wouldn't have been\\nobvious because the weird thing about\\ntwitch versus Instagram for example is\\nInstagram it's hard to uh disconnect\\nInstagram within uh Facebook right\\nbecause of all the stuff they did from\\nan ad infrastructure standpoint and you\\nknow the adoption and promotion and all\\nthat I think it's kind of hard for me to\\nmentally disconnect the two twitch was\\nto your point able to operate pretty\\nStandalone right and so almost you can\\nyou can at least from the outside in\\nmaybe you disagree almost see what the\\nbusiness would look like\\nis a CEO for a very long time and it\\npertains many of its CEOs for a very\\nvery long time like how you were there\\nDon Katz at Audible for 10 years eight\\nyears uh eight years\\num and\\nuh\\nthey do it because Amazon actually lets\\nCEOs be CEOs that's like that's uh it's\\nthe most decentralized of the big tech\\ncompanies and uh I think\\nuh if you want to sell your company and\\nkeep running it I couldn't recommend any\\nreally any big tech company other than\\nAmazon because it's the only one that\\nruns under that model\\num\\nI've thought about what it would be like\\nto have done it separately\\num and I actually just think it wouldn't\\nhave been that different the biggest\\ndifference was the reason I sold at the\\nend of the day is I don't like\\nfundraising and I knew that if I sold to\\nAmazon I'd get to keep running my\\ncompany\\nin fact they would demand I keep\\nprinting my company and that but we were\\naligned in that I wanted to and they won\\nthey wanted me to so great and they\\nwould make sure that they would they\\nwould fix the I have to raise Capital\\nevery year problem because they're\\ncommitting by buying us to fund us\\num and\\nuh or like write out pick to take a big\\nloss but like they're basically\\ncommitting to fund you and so uh that\\nworked out where I would say it worked\\nout as planned\\num\\nand so\\nuh I feel really good about the decision\\nin retrospect uh\\nI think I made it more intuitively at\\nthe time than like reasoned and it only\\ntook me a couple years after doing it to\\nactually even figure out what the math I\\nwas I had been doing subconsciously was\\nbut uh\\nbut I think it was the right to call for\\nsure what did Amazon do to keep you\\naround for so long besides just letting\\nyou run autonomously where's that at\\nthat that's yeah what that's literally\\nthe thing that they did I don't you know\\nif hey hey like you know you know big\\ntech companies if you want to retain\\nCEOs after you acquire the company you\\nhave to let them still be the CEO which\\nmeans they decide who gets hired who\\ngets fired\\nwhat contracts you sign what products\\nyou launch if you're going to take that\\naway from them make them go through your\\nprocesses there if they're any good at\\nall as a CEO they're going to leave\\nbecause they're not a CEO anymore\\nthey're a division vice president and\\nthat's not the job they signed up for so\\nFYI if you want to retain CEOs\\none weird trick what uh but did they get\\nstrategic value I guess to take it from\\ntheir Vantage Point obviously twitch is\\na very important asset within there but\\nthe the flip side of of the reason I\\nthink people end up being somewhat\\nheavy-handed or at least involving\\nthemselves post acquisition of a company\\nis to try to\\nmake the value greater than the\\nindividual component of it were there\\nthings they did from an integration\\nstandpoint or things that they pushed\\nthat benefited other parts of Amazon\\num I mean twitch advertising is sold by\\nAmazon advertising the third biggest I\\nthink third biggest I don't know if it's\\nexactly I think it's third biggest\\nadvertising company in the world so\\nthat's that's good that's like the\\nInstagram Facebook thing in a way um\\nexcept I think we provide more value to\\nAmazon relatively Facebook already had a\\nlot of AD inventory in feeds\\nthat's basically the identical whereas\\ntwitch Amazon did not have a bunch of\\nugc video and uh you know premium gaming\\nvideo to like sell against yeah that's\\nthat's them to you I was wondering you\\nto them if there was anything that oh no\\nI think actually the revert in the\\nadvertising case unlike Instagram where\\nit's mostly Instagram benefiting from\\nthe Facebook it advertising machine here\\nit's much more two-way we open up a new\\nkind of inventory they don't have access\\nto otherwise which is good for the\\noverall Amazon organization but also\\ngood for twitch because we get access to\\nthe big sales team so I think the\\nadvertising thinks the obvious just like\\nwith Instagram it's the obvious\\nintegration point for something like\\ntwitch\\num we also do stuff with prime that's\\nthat's been very good that's which are\\nquite well again very two-way\\num\\nuh and we've launched IBS um which is\\nour the interactive video service and\\nAWS service\\num very cool like to be able to take one\\nof the things core things you built and\\nexternalize it as an AWS service is very\\ncool\\num and something you can't do unless you\\ngo to I guess\\nit'd have to be Amazon Google or\\nMicrosoft basically because those are\\nthe cloud companies\\num and we definitely couldn't have done\\nthat on our own\\num but yeah a lot of it has been\\nless deeply integrated\\num and I think that that's\\nexcept for the points like advertising\\nwhich is a really big one where it does\\nmake sense to integrate and I think it's\\nreally to Amazon's credit that they\\ndidn't try to force a bunch of\\nIntegrations\\nfor efficiency reasons\\num basically if it's always efficient in\\ntheory it's never as efficient as it\\nseems in practice so\\num uh I I think strategic there are\\nstrategic Acquisitions where you're\\nbuying something as a technology you\\nknow\\nApple buys some semiconductor companies\\nso they can start making chips sure and\\nthat should get integrated it's not it's\\nnot actually a separate product but if\\nyou're buying a product to be part of\\nyour portfolio I actually don't I think\\nthe often the Integra it's the\\nIntegrations are a little heavy-handed\\nfor no good reason\\nI've heard you say that as you get money\\nthere's a clear declining value to more\\nmoney obviously that's true it sounds\\nlike something people just say but\\num how did how has that actually\\nimpacted your life having success and\\nhow would you internalize that or I mean\\nhaving money is great\\num the you know the utility of money\\ndeclines approximately with the log of\\nthe amount of money\\num you can actually see it on like uh\\nif you if you plot like you know life\\nhappiness correlation curves and stuff\\nso every 10x more money you have is like\\none incremental unit more so like it's\\nnot that there's no value of going from\\none million to 10 million\\nbut it's like 1 million 10 million is\\nthe same as a hundred thousand to a\\nmillion and so every going from one\\nmillion to two million is like yeah\\nlike it's just not that big of a deal\\neven though it is a million dollars more\\nit's like it doesn't change your life\\nthat much\\num\\nuh I am very glad to have money\\num because it makes my life directly\\nbetter in terms of consumption but most\\nof all because it allows me to do things\\nlike invest in I've invested in my\\nfriends companies or in other you know\\nin strangers companies and people I've\\nmet companies and that's being an angel\\nunless it's really interesting and I\\nfeel like I get to support people and\\nand help um I got to fund SF New Deal uh\\nright and like I got to write a check\\nfor a million dollars uh in SF New Deal\\nuh because I I had someone I knew Lenore\\nwho uh Lenora Estrada who CEO and I\\ntrusted she could step up and run it and\\nI could make that decision fast and just\\nwrite the check um I didn't have to go\\ntry to raise money from other people or\\nput it together crowdfunding it and uh\\nthat was really valuable I really like\\nstand by that being that was it was and\\nit was interesting it was fun for me\\num\\nand uh\\nuh you get to go do think cool things\\nfor your friends in your community so I\\nmean\\nyeah but I guess having money is great\\nwho doesn't like having money\\num I don't think it's the it's not the\\nonly thing\\num there's a the quote I like about\\nmoney is like\\nyou need money like if it's like on a\\nroad trip you need gas but light you\\nknow road trips are not tours of gas\\nstations and your life shouldn't be a\\ntour of money making uh activities but\\nlike also like you should think about\\nwhere the gas stations are on your road\\ntrip like it's especially if you're\\ngoing in on a long big one like you\\nreally don't want to run out of gas\\nuh over the years you've been\\nparticularly transparent about being a\\nbad manager initially uh I I there was a\\nquote you had I was bad at hard\\nconversations I was bad at good\\nconversations I was bad at delegating\\nI'm sorry to the people that worked for\\nme in the early days uh I assume you're\\nbeing too hard on yourself there but\\nwhat were some of the things you've\\nlearned about yourself and managing that\\nuh allowed you to develop into a good\\nmanager so I would say in the early days\\nI was a pretty good leader already but a\\nbad manager like I could I could inspire\\npeople with a direction I could\\ncommunicate but I I was I always stand\\nbehind when I said there I was a bad\\nmanager\\num but I don't think I'm being\\nparticularly harsh\\nI have yet to meet anyone who is a good\\nmanager the first year they are a\\nmanager I don't think anyone is uh being\\na manager is a set of skills like a\\nthousand different skills and\\nthe you aren't good at some by they're\\nnot like things you just know\\nautomatically like no one's a good skier\\nthe first time they go skiing it is not\\npossible to be good at first\\num\\nthere's only one thing that\\ndistinguishes good Managers from Bad\\nmanagers consistently that I've found\\nsome people when presented with this\\nuh don't like this truth that they suck\\nand decide that they are in fact good\\nmanagers already or that management is\\neasier that they don't that it's not any\\nthey're as good as they need to be\\nand some people\\nrealize that management is a skill and\\nthey're good at it yet and decide I I\\nwant to get better at this I want to\\nlearn how to be a better manager and\\nthey every year they're thinking about\\nhow do I get better how do I how do I\\nhow can I become a better more qualified\\nmanager and I can be better at this set\\nof skills and the people who try don't\\nalways succeed but fair amount dude\\nManagement's not so hard if you treat it\\nlike a set of skills they're not the\\nhardest skills to learn anywhere it's\\nnot as hard as like you know abstract\\nmath and inventing like new uh\\nuh you know new theorems about topology\\nthat's that is more difficult than\\nmanagement but it is it's hard enough\\nyou have to learn the people who\\ndedicate themselves to it often usually\\nnot always become good managers the\\npeople who don't are universally\\nterrible\\nand that is that is just the only thing\\nthat differentiates the people is like\\nwhether you accept into your heart you\\nneed to learn you need to get better at\\nthis thing that's basically it what was\\ncounterintuitive or what what skills\\nwere counter-intuitive to you that you\\nthat that maybe took longer to learn or\\njust were super surprising as you got\\nhigher and higher uh with more and more\\npeople the thing about management skills\\nis they're all dumb they don't they're\\nnot surprising when you say them out\\nloud they sound stupid\\num like\\nuh when you delegate something to\\nsomeone you have to actually delegate it\\nto them you can't delegate it and then\\nlike look over their shoulder and then\\ntell them they did it wrong like that's\\njust gonna make them unhappy\\num and and and worse they're gonna stop\\ntrying to even do the thing because they\\nknow whether they do it well or badly\\nyou're going to show up and then review\\nit and then make it the way you would\\nhave done it and then and so why should\\nthey put much they should this their\\nwhole goal is to get it in front of you\\nso you can correct it\\nand like that's obvious if you think\\nabout it it's not like that's a dumb\\nit's a almost dumb to get wrong and\\nalmost everyone gets it wrong when they\\nfirst become a manager because it's a\\nlittle it it's I guess it's\\ncounterintuitive but I don't even think\\nit's the counterintuitiveness it's just\\nyou don't most of management is learning\\nto notice\\nthe Thousand and One things that you can\\ndo wrong and if you thought about each\\none of them you would probably come to\\nthe right answer but you just\\nthis doesn't occur to even notice\\num\\nI guess the thing that one\\ncounterintuitive thing about management\\nthat was a surprise to me is that\\nmanaging individual contributors on a\\nteam\\nis not the same job as managing a team\\nof managers is not the same job as\\nmanaging a team of managers and managers\\nit's not the same job as managing a team\\nof directors it's not the team same as\\nmanaging a team of VPS and that's not\\nthe same as managing a team of spps\\nevery time you add a layer to the\\ncompany\\nyour job is like oh it doesn't have\\nnothing in common but it's fundamentally\\nquite different\\num and that's one of the reasons why\\nit's so hard to scale teams and people\\nlike sort of\\nuh hit a scaling limit at some point\\nit's because if you keep a fast growing\\ncompany everyone's like winding up\\nunderwater all the time as layers under\\nyou get more layers under them and that\\nthat directory was doing such a great\\njob is doing a bad job now they didn't\\nget bad the job changed from underneath\\nthem and so everyone's in this race to\\nlike figure out the new job before it uh\\nbefore it kills them what changes in\\nthose levels of abstraction like I mean\\nat a high level when you're when you're\\nso far removed what is so different than\\nbeing on the ground\\nI would say like uh the you have just\\nthe techniques you you have to use\\ntechniques that scale better as you get\\nthat\\nrather than things that are maximally\\neffective you want things that are scale\\nbest\\nand that like the trade-off between how\\neffective is this individual interaction\\nhow good it how like in the beginning\\nyou need things you need to actually fix\\nproblems and ship code and make things\\nhappen\\num and that kind of dynamism is really\\nimportant as you get higher and higher\\nin a hierarchy\\nyou have to figure out how you can make\\nyour time and your effort and your your\\nenergy scale because you can't go do it\\nThing by thing and so there's a\\ntrade-off between those two things and\\nyou are uh you need to pick either the\\nskills that you need are more of the\\nscale scale level skills\\num writing becomes more important when\\nyou're higher in the organization for\\nexample\\nas you get higher and higher and the\\ncompany gets bigger and bigger there's\\nalso a component of transparency and\\ninput of decisioning that you can't be\\ncan't be quite the same as it was in the\\nearly days right like the decisions all\\nthe inputs that went into an individual\\ndecision you can't communicate in Mass\\nto the totality of the company which I\\nthink could be hard I think that could\\nbe hard when you come from a culture of\\nlike full transparency or it was small\\nand now you're big and all that did you\\ndid you experience that was that\\nsomething that you struggled with of\\njust like how to balance transparency\\nwith just giving people the outputs of\\nstuff\\nyeah I mean there's\\npeople can use the word transparency a\\nlot but what they mean is input\\num you can give transparency for stuff\\nactually not everything but most things\\nno matter how big you are a lot of the\\ntime the transparency just makes people\\nmore upset though because what they\\nreally meant when they said they wanted\\ntransparency is they wanted a voice\\nand that you cannot scale everyone\\ncannot have a voice on everything\\num\\nin fact almost everyone can't have a\\nvoice on almost everything and uh\\nthat's not true when you're small it\\ngets true and you're bigger when you're\\nsmall you can stay very very\\nsynchronized and as you get bigger\\neverything has to just desync\\num\\nand\\nuh\\nfigure creating mechanisms and processes\\nso that the right people can have input\\nat the right time is like that is the\\nart of management and and production in\\na company of Greater size and like I\\ndon't know there's no there's no short\\nanswer to that question that like is it\\nall meaningful but\\nuh\\nI think that\\nthe main metaphor I always use for it is\\nlike you have to you have to Shard the\\ndecision making like sharding is any\\ndifferent programming and from like\\ndatabases where you have to find a way\\nthat you can divide stuff up such that\\nsome set of the of the data of the\\ndecisions can be made in this hundred\\npeople and this hundred people in this\\ngroup owns everything about that and\\nthey don't have to communicate much with\\nthe other groups and figure out how you\\ncan bottleneck and shrink those uh\\nbetween group Communications and and let\\npeople interact in a more asynchronous\\nway\\num and again there's a thousand and one\\ntechniques for that but that's what you\\nhave to figure out how to do what was\\nsomething that you you found that even\\nafter uh whatever 10 12 years how long\\nwould you run it uh 17 years 17 years\\nfrom from Justin TV and what was\\nsomething that you found that was just\\nyou were never going to be particularly\\ngood at and that you needed to augment\\nuh or or get people around you to to\\nhelp you with\\nI think I uh what I discovered is I\\ncould be good at literally anything\\num there was no skill I could not learn\\nbut there were a lot of things where\\nuh I don't like doing it I'm never going\\nto enjoy doing it and it's always going\\nto drain energy from my day\\nand by the end of the day if I'm doing a\\nbunch of that kind of work\\nI'm gonna be grumpy and unhappy and\\ntired and people interacting with me are\\nprobably not gonna have the best\\nexperience\\num and so it was less about what I could\\nget good at I could get good at almost\\nanything\\nat least you don't once\\num\\nit was more about like what could I do\\nsustainably what what what how do I\\nmanage my job so that I am doing things\\nsustainably in a way where I am can\\nconsistently do it at high quality uh\\nwhen I'm not at my best\\num and so for me one of those things is\\nlike I\\nreally\\nhave never been great at interviewing I\\ndon't like interviewing uh new\\ncandidates for jobs\\num there's a lot of energy for me to\\nmeet new person and\\nbring bring that their who they are on\\nand make a connection and like I like\\ndoing it actually uh\\nwhen the either someone I find myself\\nnaturally drawn to which is you know\\nwhatever one in four people or something\\nlike which I don't think is unusual\\nin terms of the one in four part I think\\nit's just an unusually high energy cost\\nfor me for the other three\\nand\\nI can do it\\nand I've learned how to do it and I've\\nbut I don't like doing it and so I've\\njust found ways for that idea was not\\nthe first person I I had this heroic\\nidea like hiring is super important I\\nneed to be the only one out there you\\nknow interviewing for the new CFO\\num\\nor the new you know head of product or\\nwhatever that turned up a terrible idea\\nI was grumpy all the time if I did that\\num then instead the right thing for me\\nto do was uh let other people do most of\\nthe interviewing and only interview you\\nknow two or three final candidates\\num\\nand you're sort of admitting that you\\ndon't have to like all the all the work\\nyou do\\nyou tweeted recently management lessons\\nfrom the front number seven six one I\\ndon't I didn't go back to look if there\\nwere actually 760 before of the in front\\nof them but your reports will ask you a\\nlot of stuff especially in the beginning\\nlike should we do X or Y do not be\\ntricked this is usually usually\\nunintentional trap the only correct\\nresponse is what what do you recommend\\ndoes that tie back to the autonomy of\\ndecisioning and being able to delegate\\nyeah if you\\nand this is this is not to say that you\\nshould never answer your reports\\nquestions I'll be really clear uh some\\npeople interpreted me as saying uh in\\nthat uh you should uh when when if you\\ntell the report like uh you tell you you\\nif you tell someone like uh\\nuh\\nyou know hey go go make this thing go\\nbuild this thing and they come back and\\nsay oh well there's this trade-off\\nthat's above my pay grade uh you know\\nthe company yeah I have to commit the\\ncompany to 20 million dollars of\\nliability or we have to spend an extra\\n16 weeks doing this and I kind of think\\nwe should actually commit to the\\nliability but like\\nwhat do you think that's a fair question\\nthat is not\\nthat is not uh\\nuh it's not their job to figure out uh\\nyou know some individual contributor you\\nknow\\na new person on the marketing team is\\nnot the company's job to figure out\\nshould we run this level of risk no no\\nfair and those often get kicked up the\\nchain and that kind of taking on a risk\\nsometimes requires all the way up to the\\nCEO to sign off totally reasonable\\nbut when you ask someone like hey like\\nuh like they're designing a new a new ad\\ncampaign\\nif they come to you and they say like oh\\nwell do you think we should make the ad\\ncampaign's message this message or that\\nmessage that is literally the that's the\\njob of the person who's you asked to go\\nshould we use this creative approach or\\nthat creative approach it's your ad\\ncampaign like you tell me\\num because if you don't do that\\nthey don't own the decision\\num and the whole point is to delegate\\ndown both the authority to make the\\ndecision and the accountability for the\\nresults of that decision\\num\\nand in very dysfunctional companies\\nsometimes\\nuh\\npeople\\nhave learned you they actually don't\\nhave the actually have the authority to\\nknow what no one tells them and that\\nmeans they don't want the accountability\\nand you want to put this entire circle\\nof them very logically constantly trying\\nto push off accountability by getting\\ninput and making sure everyone is signed\\noff and they never have to make a\\ndecision to take any risk and that's\\nbecause they know they don't actually\\nhave the authority\\nand they don't really believe they'll be\\nallowed to do a good job\\num\\nand I I have empathy for people who are\\nstuck in that situation it happens even\\nin good companies it happens sometimes\\nuh but the the good solution is not then\\nget everyone to sign off on everything\\nso it's all safe but rather than\\nactually Empower people to make\\ndecisions\\nso it so that they you can actually just\\ndo stuff\\nyou did a great YC talk with regard to\\nproduct development\\num about how to think about developing\\nproduct and talking to your users and\\ncustomers users and customers or\\ncompeting Services as well as other\\npeople that aren't using your product uh\\ntoday we touched on product development\\na little bit and the three pillars that\\nyou guys kind of use to think about\\num\\nhow\\nyou think about\\nI guess now it's probably been 10 years\\nor eight years since you did that talk\\nhow do you think about product\\ndevelopment and actually figuring out\\nthe features that matter at a zoomed out\\nlevel maybe not twitch specifically but\\njust like how do you make these\\nprioritizations so that\\nthat\\nuh saying that comes to mind for me for\\nthis is um\\nplanning is a central plans are useless\\nI think it's like a like Eisenhower or\\nsomething some general\\num\\nand it's totally correct because you\\nif you don't make a plan where you're\\ngonna get you know from point A to point\\nB\\nyou're gonna miss so much stuff and\\nyou're you're gonna fail\\nbut once you make the plan no plans\\nSurprise contact with the Enemy as soon\\nas you start executing you realize like\\noh that didn't actually work this didn't\\nactually work you have to improvise\\num\\ntalking to customers is essential\\num but the results of talking to\\ncustomers is useless\\nlike it is the talking to the customers\\nand they're really paying attention that\\ninforms your intuition that then lets\\nyou design the product you're not you're\\nnot delegating the mistake people make\\nis they're trying to delegate product\\ndesign to the customer\\nand if they were so good at the product\\ndesign they would be starting the\\ncompany they would be the product\\nmanager they're not good at product\\ndesign\\nthey know what problems they're running\\ninto they know the realities of their\\nbusiness\\nand what you need to do is you need to\\nunderstand them incredibly deeply\\nnot get them to do your job for you so\\nalmost the inverse of the manager\\nsituation don't delegate that to them\\num\\nthe this that's one One Direction you\\nmake the mistake is you try to delegate\\nthe product design to the customer no no\\nyou designed the product you talk to\\nthem you get you understand them and you\\nuse that to design the product the other\\nside of it is you have this you come up\\nwith a great idea and you got to talk to\\ncustomers to validate it validate is the\\nlike uh\\nand I hear we'll talk about validating\\nproduct ideas I uh I instantly know that\\nthere's a there's a problem because\\nonce you've had the idea\\nno amount of talking to any number of\\ncustomers will change how good of an\\nidea that was it is exactly as good as\\nit is the moment you have it and you can\\nhave a thousand customers tell you it's\\na great idea\\nit was or was not and it will a great\\nidea and it will or not have the impact\\nbefore they've told you or after if a\\nthousand years will tell you it's a bad\\nidea same thing doesn't change anything\\nand unless you are actually throwing\\naway lots of ideas customers tell you\\nthey don't like them\\nyou're not having any impact at all and\\nto the most and I've also just I that\\nnever happens\\nevery now and then people valid ideas\\nand throw them away and actually what's\\neven funnier there is it's usually when\\nthey do actually throw them away those\\nvideos might have been good the\\ncustomers are just bad product designers\\nand they don't realize that actually is\\na good solution to their problem\\nbut\\num\\nthe uh\\nthe main thing is\\nthe order is wrong you need to talk to\\ncustomers\\nuh first and then have your great ideas\\nand so like there's this uh idea from\\nthe rationalist community online that I\\nreally like holding off and proposing\\nSolutions\\num\\nholding off on proposing Solutions is\\none of the key product design skills\\nbecause you have to like know there's a\\nproblem and not come up with the\\nsolution long enough to actually go like\\ngather some data and think about it um\\nbecause once you come up with a solution\\nyou're it's actually your brain is like\\nattached to it it's really hard to like\\nlet go some people can do it but it's\\nsurprisingly difficult\\nthere's a uh I want to talk about more\\nabout decisioning and one as it relates\\nto\\num when you had four co-founders Kyle\\nMichael Justin and yourself in a room\\nyou mentioned there was ultimately kind\\nof a war of attrition on decisioning\\nthat it was whoever was Last Man\\nStanding kind of got the got the vote\\nwe had a real hybrid model so we would\\nwe would have uh these like epic debates\\nwhich were mostly useless and sometimes\\nwe would do the thing of like the person\\nwho like had the most stamina but often\\nit was just like\\nthere's this other thing happening which\\nlike whoever just did stuff they got\\ntheir way too\\nlike uh that was Kyle's main move but\\nactually it was my move and a lot\\nMichael's moves too like we'd argue\\nabout it and then we'd uh we'd go off\\nand like all just like do stuff and\\nactually I would say in retrospect\\nit's a little bit of the planning as\\nessential plans are useless thing we\\ncould the arguments could have been less\\ncontentious\\nand we could have probably shortened the\\ndebates but they were valuable and we\\nwould we would game it out we would\\nargue it out extensively we would hear\\nfrom all the sides and the person who's\\nin charge of that would go make a\\ndecision to make stuff happen and\\nactually that's actually in\\nretrospective\\nrelatively functional process\\num because there was a distribution of\\nauthority and accountability\\nalthough it it maybe was an unpleasant\\nit was an unpleasant but kind of\\neffective approach\\nas I would say it was like a high\\nunpleasant medium effective I wouldn't\\nreally recommend it as a you can do\\nbetter there's more Pareto optimal\\noutcomes but like\\nbut it's better than the stuff that's\\nineffective\\none one question on uh I guess just\\nbecause it's been a big debate uh of\\nlate is the remote work thing and now\\nhaving lived through Justin TV and\\ntwitch and seeing all the discourse\\nonline you're uh you're working with Y\\ncombinator now like what's your what's\\nyour perspective on remote work and\\ndecisioning that specific question I\\nguess you had tweeted out my observation\\nyou can build a two by two for workplace\\nenvironments remote local and\\nhierarchical versus egalitarian there is\\nan island of stability out and deep and\\nremote and hierarchical uh what did you\\nmean by that and what's your perspective\\non remote so the island of stability is\\nan idea from like the periodic table\\nwhere like as hell elements get heavier\\nand heavier they become unstable but\\nthere's a theorize we've yet to\\nsynthesize in one of these elements as a\\ntheorized island of stability way out at\\nlike a very high Neutron proton count\\nwhere suddenly the elements get stable\\nagain for a little bit\\num uh but there's like but in the\\nin-between options are all bad\\num and are unstable and intensely\\nradioactive\\num and I I've seen I I know a couple\\ncompanies that are very effective remote\\nand what differs the way they differ\\nfrom the traditional Valley culture is\\nit's not uh distribution of authority\\neverybody like you know is a autonomy\\neveryone figure out what to do on their\\nown it's like the Army like there's\\nthere's delegation there's delegation of\\nauthority but it's not this delegation\\nof authority and distribution of\\nauthority are not the same and\\nuh\\nthey are all over\\nauditing and follow-up and interactions\\nand documentation and you have to\\ndocument your work and you submit it and\\nyou can you can build\\na mechanism and a culture that works\\nremote\\num but the valley approach I think I\\nthink of it kind of economically in its\\nmost extreme of like the Google Vibe of\\nlike\\nyeah like no real accountability like\\ndirectly like because we don't really\\nknow what's good and like go experiment\\nand try stuff and like maybe it'll work\\nand like no real urgency to like launch\\nstuff fast\\nthat that does not work remote it works\\nokay in person because there's sort of\\nthis weird implicit social pressure\\nthing that gets used in place of\\nofficial\\nuh methods to like manage stuff\\nbut once you take that away and you\\ndon't have the official thing either\\nit's just like bad uh and so\\nthere's the silica the valley culture\\nworks there's a reason why like Silicon\\nValley's taken over like you know it\\ndidn't evolve for no reason but you\\ncan't take that culture and Transplant\\nit into a remote work environment and\\nexpect it to work\\num\\nand I think we'll slowly sort of like\\nyou'll start to see models that'll be\\nlike oh you're on this month you're on\\nthis model you're under that model\\num\\nuh and I think that that will uh\\nuh I think that will that'll be good for\\nus actually well they'll if you really\\ncare a lot about remote you'll go work\\nat a company there's a remote culture\\nthat works\\num\\nI actually like love the in-office thing\\nuh I love being able to be remote\\nsometimes but like\\nuh\\nI just I enjoy being around my\\nco-workers I enjoy people to see them in\\nthe face I like the organic parts of it\\num but I know not everybody does\\num and I'm really happy that they get to\\ngo work at a remote environment that\\nhopefully has a functional not\\ndysfunctional remote culture\\ngoals and okrs versus intentions\\nyou prefer to focus on intentions than\\nokrs rather than being tied to specific\\ngoals can you elaborate on that I mean\\nthat's that's when we're on a personal\\nbasis than on a on a corporate basis\\nlike at a corporate basis goals are very\\nimportant like you need to actually\\nsetting goals as a I could probably give\\nan entire hour-long talk on like setting\\ngoals and the trade-offs in various ways\\nto do that but uh at an individual level\\num\\nsetting goals for yourself can be fun\\nbut ultimately goals are usually a way\\nto coerce yourself or whip yourself into\\ndoing a thing you don't want to do you\\nshould have set a goal and like that's\\nwhy you need them in the corporate\\nenvironment people have to sometimes be\\na little bit coerced into doing\\nsomething that's less than the thing\\nthat they want to actually do but it's\\nimportant to the company even though\\nit's not the most interesting exciting\\nto them personally and you're trying to\\nartificial excitement and fun\\nit can be inspiring it could be exciting\\nto try to get a goal to it doesn't have\\nto be always a whip there's a carrot\\nthere too but even carrots are coercion\\nlike ultimately it let the intrinsic\\nthing itself you're you're\\nusing reward or punishment like\\noperative conditioning on a dog to get\\nit to Tran to do what you want\\nthere's a place for that but like\\nI try not to like\\ncoerce myself all the time\\num and I find that an over focus on\\ngoals like goals are set with your\\nintellectual\\nlike top-down analytical mind and if\\nyou're good at setting them you can be\\neffective with it but like your internet\\nyou're like top analytical mind is only\\nso good and\\nit's easy to set a goal that is not it\\nit's like related to what you wanted to\\ndo but not quite what you actually\\nwanted to do and then that's very\\ndangerous because it you can spend years\\nsometimes pursuing this and achieving\\nand succeeding\\nonly to find out oops I didn't actually\\nthat goal was that was like sort of\\nright but it missed this important thing\\nand now I'm like I have to actually go\\nway back and start over\\num and so I mostly think about it in\\nterms of like uh\\nyou know I really concrete one like\\ndon't set a weight loss goal\\nuh set an intention about uh wanting to\\nbe strong and healthy\\nand acting in accordance with that\\num and\\nit's creating an infrastructure to\\nsupport you and doing that well\\num this is the book I think about on\\nthis a lot is the score takes care of\\nitself\\nYeah by Walsh that's that's got books\\ngreat and I think it really it's for\\nthose people from Reddit it's the idea\\nof like what\\nyou the score in the game is literally\\nirrelevant if he's a football coach and\\nyou ignore\\nthe score score like screw that like uh\\nuh what's important is\\ndid you practice did you do the practice\\nyou needed to do or did you everyone\\nshow up to practice they give they give\\npractice they're all\\nand if they if you they did that you're\\ngonna win or lose the game\\nthat will that that will take care of\\nitself and I find that's very true for\\nfor goal setting\\num\\nthe goals tend to focus you on the score\\nor creating a score you're you're going\\nto create a way to score yourself\\nand that's not necessarily the best way\\nto do it I I don't know if we have an\\nhour to do the uh the setting goals for\\na company thing but is there a short\\nprimer on how you think about setting\\ngoals or okrs for companies uh\\nuh no like uh let me see some if I have\\nany maxims about goals\\num\\nobviously it sounds like focusing on\\ninputs versus outputs is uh no you need\\na blend of input and output goals\\nbecause the output goals keep you honest\\nand the info goals keep you focused uh\\nI'd say\\nuh\\nthere's a lot of different kinds of\\ngoals you said for different kinds of\\nreasons and the most important thing is\\nto be kind of clear with yourself like\\none goal except for twitch was like I\\nwant us to have a million people earning\\nmoney on Twitch in five years 2016. I set a goal we had like at the time I\\nthink 15 000 people earning money\\nten thousand something like that and I\\nwas like it was ten thousand and I said\\ngo I wanna have a million people earning\\nmoney\\non Twitch by the end of 2021 and we hit\\nit because of covet we hit it actually\\nearly 2021 which I'm very proud of we I\\ncall that weirdly accurate but I didn't\\nreally call it I I uh God I sound like a\\nhippie like I manifested it right like\\nby just saying that to the company and\\nhaving people think about that\\nuh\\nit generated things like other people\\ninventing things like the affiliate\\nprogram\\nwell if we're gonna have a million\\npeople earning money we have to have a\\nreally easy way for people to sign up to\\nearn money and so we created the\\naffiliate program and like\\nand then a bunch of other things like\\nthat right\\num and\\nthat's one kind of goal that's like a\\nfive-year goal that's like I had no idea\\nhow to achieve it was very output\\noriented and supposed to be sort of an\\ninspirational goal but then you also set\\ngoals like you know this quarter we need\\nto get our uh you know the number of TPS\\nreports filed up by 17 and those goals\\ncan be very effective and important also\\num\\nyou know and I I think it's like uh\\nuh\\nit's the\\nthey're useful for different things\\nthey're motivating to different people\\nin different contexts and you should\\njust not confuse\\neach of the goals for each other\\nI know you're a big believer in coaches\\nand that a coach will pay for itself as\\nsoon as you can afford it I guess maybe\\ncan you tell the story of your coach and\\nthen ultimately why you think it's\\nimportant how you go about assessing a\\nmentor or a coach along the way yeah I\\nthink I got very lucky so you know with\\nmy coach uh he was a introduced to me by\\nStuart alsop uh who's our on our board\\num the yeah and it was our first in you\\nknow PC investment\\num and uh when I gave CEO shortly after\\nhe uh he recommended I start working\\nwith Jose\\num and I said all right I'll give that a\\ntry\\num\\nand I was honestly a little skeptical at\\nfirst but I was like\\nuh I guess I took getting better at\\nbeing a CEO very seriously and if this\\nthing could help I wanted to give it a\\ngive it a shot\\num and\\nYoshi has had taken his previous company\\npublic who had been a CEO before and\\nthen he pivoted into wanting to do\\ncoaching and I feel very lucky I got\\nsomeone who had that level of background\\nbecause\\nI think it's very hard to coach a CEO if\\nyou haven't lived seen been part of that\\nI don't know if you had to be a CEO\\nexactly but if you haven't at least been\\nan executive or you know a board member\\nor something if you haven't been part of\\nthose decisions it's hard to give to do\\ngood coaching\\num\\ncoaching is valuable because it it\\ncreates a space where you\\nyou uh get to have someone who has no\\nincentive other than helping you\\nhold a mirror up\\nfor you to what you're saying what\\nyou're doing what your goals are and\\nhelping you and what your intentions are\\nand helping you live more in accordance\\nwith those and notice what you're doing\\nbetter or doing worse and there's a bit\\nof coaching where it's like literally\\njust advice like uh\\nuh you know how\\nwhat what are the what are tactical\\ntricks to handle this given situation\\nbut honestly like that's like the the\\nless important side of coaching and\\nmentorship the more important side is\\nlike you're almost uh\\nyou're learning the questions they ask\\nand you're learning to ask their\\nquestions of yourself consistently\\num\\nthe\\nyou know you have a coach that is you\\nyou have to really come I think the the\\nway to think about coaching is sort of\\nlike uh fine selecting a good coach a\\nlittle bit so I think a therapist\\nreflecting a good\\num you know a good partner or something\\non a on a startup a good co-founder\\nyou know it's working when you have more\\nlike positive surprises than negative\\nones you know where it's working when\\nyou feel you're growing you're you know\\nthe things you learned there you find\\nyourself repeating to other people\\num and uh and so they definitely\\nrecommend it but I also think that a lot\\nof coaches aren't that good and so like\\nthere's a process of looking and\\nselecting how do you go about assessing\\nthe relationship and make it is it just\\nare you getting I'm a worst person to\\nask I got very lucky number one great\\none I'm one for one I don't know what to\\ntell you like it's like people who like\\nmet their sweetheart yeah high school\\nsweetheart and they were like the person\\nfor them and it's just it's great and\\nthey're deliriously happy with that\\nperson 30 years later it's like that's\\namazing for you but like not an\\nactionable plan for anyone else yeah\\nhard to explain yeah so actually I have\\nvery you need I have great advice about\\nhow to go about learning how to build\\nproduct because I sucked at it I I\\ndidn't get it right a bunch of times\\nyou know I actually think later Drew I\\nlove Drew but I bet he gives bad advice\\nto startups about how to go about\\nfinding your very first glimmer as a\\nproduct Market fit because he happened\\nto build the right thing true house your\\nhouse yeah yeah Drew managed to build\\nthe right product\\njust like\\ndirectly he just directly somehow I\\nthink he's very obviously very good at\\nproduct but like he just did it oh yeah\\nnobody does that like that's what I feel\\nabout Twitter today yeah\\nyou can't you can't advise anyone if\\nyou've done like that's you don't know\\nhow to figure how to get from failure to\\nsuccess because you never spend any time\\nin Failure\\num Drew has a lot of great advice about\\nscaling a company uh because he's had to\\nstruggle with that\\nI want to go back in time so you were a\\npart of the first original YC batch\\nwhich also was Steve Huffman Alexis\\nOhanian of Reddit uh Sam Altman as well\\nas you look back on the success of the\\ngroup of people uh that came out of that\\nhow much do you put that just the people\\ninnately the insights and Lessons\\nLearned right place right time some\\nother variable I'm not thinking about\\nI mean I certainly think you know I have\\nto we all have to credit Paul with like\\nbeing an incredible mentor to all of us\\num and like really\\nI do think you know leveling us all up a\\nlittle bit like I I absolutely don't\\nthink it's a coincidence but I also\\nthink\\nthis is true of YC today it's true of\\nevery Elite University\\nselection effect system it's like this\\nmassive part of it and it's not just\\nit's not that so much that YC was some\\nbrilliant filter or that filtered out\\nthe best people it's like who thought in\\n2005 remember in 2005 when I graduated\\nit was the smallest computer science\\nclass that Yale had graduated in years\\nbecause uh\\nthe tech that the tech was over\\nanyone who is like reading Paul Graham's\\nessays thought it was a good idea to\\nstart a startup in 2005. I thought it\\nwas a good idea to go take a risk on a\\nsomething like YC like that seemed like\\nthat it drew in people who\\nturned it would turn out that that was a\\na good like trap for people who turned\\nout to be uh ambitious and talented and\\na good vintage to be starting companies\\nit was great\\nit was very counter uh narrative which\\nis always the best time to be starting\\nright we're starting at the bottom and\\nso yeah YC classes of like 050607\\nparticularly like before the density is\\na little higher I don't know that's\\nactually true like that is pretty high\\nlater too but like\\nit certainly pulls in a lot of\\nuh it pulled in a lot of uh very\\ntalented people because\\nuh it was\\nit wasn't prestigious yet so you only\\ndid it if you were like really committed\\nto wanting to do a startup because even\\nthough that sounded like even though\\neveryone was telling me it was a bad\\nidea to do that\\num and I think that's like\\nuh\\nuh that's actually all still the best\\nreason to start a startup um fortunately\\nstarting a startup is so painful that\\nmostly that people still do it unlike a\\nlot of things that people do for fun uh\\nbecause they're supposed to starting a\\nstartup is so painful that most people\\njust select out correctly because unless\\nyou like buying your paying economy size\\nthey don't really recommend it\\nwhat what did what did Paul do uniquely\\nwell in those early days I mean the\\nwhole institution he started has\\nobviously lasted and but Paul's\\nsupervised superpower by far his\\nsuperpower like he's Paul's very smart\\ngood a lot of things but it's by far\\nsuperpower is you somehow walk away it's\\neveryone this is me but also Justin and\\nalso everyone else I talked to another\\nYC you somehow walk away from the\\nconversation with Paul believing\\nwe are\\nthe shed we are smart\\ncapable and we're going to take over the\\nworld and the only thing standing\\nbetween us and taking over the world is\\nwe have to like go grind even harder we\\nbut like Paul believes in us but it's\\nnot\\nwhat's happening is like Paul believes\\nin you so you believe in yourself but\\nit's not actually but somehow he doesn't\\nhe doesn't feel like Paul Believes In Me\\nit feels like\\nPaul just sees that I'm obviously\\nextremely talented and capable and like\\nI mean I'm just I'm the only issue maybe\\nI'm aiming too small should we be aiming\\nbigger\\nbut it feels like he's just noticed this\\nfact that now you can see two\\nand that is such a gift to be able to\\ngive to people\\nbecause I think I think that did what it\\ngave us was the most important thing\\nthat startup Founders need and I think\\nthat anyone doing anything ambitious\\nneeds\\nwhich is the like gumption to keep going\\nwhen things aren't looking so hot Midway\\nthrough\\nuh and Paul really convey like Paul's\\nthat's that Paul gives that to people I\\nthink that's like that is by far his his\\ngreatest Talent which is which is funny\\nbecause he has a lot of other talents\\nbut like that's uh that's a big one\\nso so it was you Alexis uh uh Steve\\nHuffman Paul like was it Sam Altman was\\nit obvious at that\\npoint in time that something special was\\nin the room or was it hey uh we're in\\nthe room with that no no absolutely not\\nI mean\\nyes in the sense that like\\nI thought everyone seemed smart and good\\nbut and and like are you coming from\\nYale and I'm sure yeah there are good\\npeople there yeah and I'd I'd been in\\nseveral Elite programs in my life where\\nthere's other smart people\\nuh\\nI I had that sense more like joining\\nTech in San Francisco at that time\\nlike in Boston and Cambridge not really\\nwhen we moved to San Francisco\\nit was like oh\\noh I'm in the middle of like Ground Zero\\nof something\\num\\nand it actually wasn't the first batch\\nthe first batch was just like some weird\\nsummer program but when the batches kept\\ngetting bigger and I would meet the new\\nFounders and like more companies\\nand they had a building as much\\neveryone's in the and like it's like oh\\noh where this is something the thing is\\nhappening around me that became very\\nclear about like 2000 by early 2007\\nabsolutely but at first no it was just\\njust it just seemed like a thing\\nit was cool I was really grateful I got\\nto do got to raise money and like start\\na company didn't have to go like live\\nwith my parents to like\\nstart in their basement\\nwas it obvious Sam was going to be the\\nleader of the Free World\\nuh no\\nit was obvious Sam was an incredible\\ndeals guy like he was he was somehow\\nconvincing the uh phone companies to\\ngive his startup that like didn't really\\nhave a product like deals I still don't\\nknow how he did that and like he's doing\\nthe same thing like convincing Microsoft\\nto like you know buy his fusions power\\nlike Sam is still an incredible deals\\nguy obviously uh but that that was that\\nthat was the only obvious thing about\\nSam at the time was like that he was he\\nwas ambitious but we had most of us were\\npretty ambitious and he was great at\\ngreat great deals guy\\nyou said something interesting once the\\nonly reason you ask about Tam is to\\nunderstand the Ambitions of the founder\\nuh can you tell me why why you think\\nthat why you approach investing in that\\nway or why you approach thinking about\\nTam in that way what was the Tam of uh\\nlive reality television\\nuh whatever Justin was willing to pay\\nyou at the time yeah yeah like nothing\\nbasically um and yet that's pretty live\\nstreaming shows a pretty pretty big\\nbusiness\\num\\nI ask people about Tam a lot and I'll\\npush them on it but it's like it's\\nbecause\\nwhat you're trying to figure out is\\ndo they have a story\\nthey might have a lot of holes in it and\\nlike we're like questionable assumptions\\nwe're like they're trying to build\\nsomething really great and big\\nor do they have a story that's like oh\\nyeah yeah I well no don't worry about\\nthe Tam we're just gonna flip this to\\nGoogle uh in two years once we hire the\\ntalent like that's a really bad sign\\ncompanies don't get built by people who\\nwho are looking for the exit\\nyou want people who are looking to build\\nsomething big something great\\num\\nbecause they even built something\\nmedium-sized you have to be trying to\\nbuild something really great and if\\nyou're if you don't if you're not if\\nyou're aiming for the aqua hire you're\\nprobably not even gonna get that\\num\\nand uh and so it's a very important\\nquestion but the point is not to like\\nthat you can actually analyze the Tam\\nper se\\nand I think that's a little different\\nfor more established Founders especially\\nit's a little different in places where\\nthere's more you need more commitment up\\nfront more Capital up front to get going\\nbecause the other thing I look for is\\nthat there's Founders who there's this\\ntrap you can wind up in where you you\\nstart is there is the\\nif you're building for a customer\\nthat doesn't exist or like that hates\\nbuying software or that like doesn't\\nwant to doesn't want any anything to do\\nwith this the whole thing that's bad so\\nlike\\nI don't care if your thing credibly\\nyou know isn't is every developer on\\nEarth is actually going to use your\\nproduct but building software for\\ndevelopers is a good plan there are a\\nlot of developers and they spend a lot\\nof money on software and so even if\\nyou're wrong about your exact thing it's\\ngoing to be okay like the software\\ndeveloper Market is big\\nif you're building market for software\\nthat's like really for public school\\nlibrarians that's the only people and\\nyou're like and I'm pushing you I'm like\\ndude isn't this bigger than that you're\\nlike no no it's for public school\\nlibrarians\\nI'm really worried for you because even\\nif you like crush it\\nthat's not actually they don't nothing\\nwrong with Librarians they don't even\\nbuy they don't like buying software in\\nthe first place\\nand there aren't that many of them so\\nlike\\nthat's maybe not a great idea and so\\nlike and and Founders can kind of get\\ntrapped in these ideas where they're\\nbuilding okay businesses targeted at\\nvery small groups of people who don't\\nwant to buy their product\\num and so it's more about your\\njust in theory if you executed like\\ncrazy and figured out six things that we\\ndidn't even think of in this room\\non a pivoted idea that's like halfway\\nonly halfway connected to your idea\\nwould that be a big business no okay\\nmaybe maybe we should change ideas yeah\\nuh there's two options for companies you\\ncan either be generally you can either\\nbe early or late uh and I I get the\\nfeeling being early is probably better\\nhow do you think about timing a timing a\\nmarket and making sure that you're there\\nto ride that wave and the differences\\nbetween being too early and too late\\nyou're\\nevery startup that wins pretty much not\\neveryone but like 98 uh\\nis too early\\nbecause if you're not too early you're\\nusually too late because if you think\\nabout it you're trying to like there\\nthere is some optimal day\\nlike literally there's probably a day\\nwhere like\\nstart if you start the company on this\\nday\\neverything will be available as you need\\nit there will be sufficient Bama through\\nyour idea they'll be sufficient this to\\nyou know the modernization techniques\\nwill work the distribution will be in\\nplace\\nbut if you start it on that day someone\\nelse when everything actually becomes\\navailable everyone else someone else\\nwill have started it a year earlier\\nstupidly\\njust by random chance because every idea\\nis getting started over and over again\\nand they will be in motion and they will\\nhave infrastructure and they will have a\\nproduct built and suddenly their product\\nwill be working and you will be too late\\nand so what you're trying to do is\\nlike so if you think about it for Justin\\nTV we were too early bandwidth was too\\nexpensive to make our business work uh\\nand almost honestly most people couldn't\\neven watch didn't have good Advantage\\nbut we've been watched reasonably\\nquality live video and the video ad\\nMarket didn't exist\\nwe didn't have a business it was\\nimportant but we but but there were\\nother startups that tried to compete\\nwith us several that started later\\nand they just got destroyed because we'd\\nbuilt Global live video infrastructure\\nfor the past four years\\nand they hadn't\\nand so\\nyou know from when the start gun went\\noff on like oh no no the business works\\nnow\\nthere's just how do you catch up with\\nsomeone with a four-year Head Start\\nstill led by the founder CEO still like\\ngrinding super hard trying to make it\\nwork like you're just screwed I mean so\\na big part of it is if you if you have\\nfaith that your thing is going to work\\nand the pieces are going to come into\\nplace the question for startups is how\\ndo you survive\\nthat's why you read so much about like\\nYC's advice to like be a cockroach like\\ndon't don't don't be a uh uh graceful\\nswallow be a cockroach because you're\\nusually too early and you just have to\\nsurvive and survive\\nUntil It's a combination of like you\\nfind the secret thing but often it's\\nactually like you didn't change anything\\nthe market caught up with the future\\nthat you saw that you can't ever time\\nexactly right and suddenly your thing\\nthat wasn't good is good and boom like\\nAirbnb is a good example of that\\nactually I think like they they had a\\nproduct and yes they did iterate and\\nthey did figure stuff out but like a big\\npart of it was like people got\\ncomfortable with the idea of like host\\nlisting stuff on the internet and\\nrenting through uh renting other\\npeople's stuff uh and\\nand the business that didn't work and\\nwasn't good became a business that did\\nwork and became it was good and I think\\nthat's a it's a very common pattern\\ntalking about cockroaches and you guys\\nwere certainly that with Justin TV\\num\\nfrugality uh being\\nsomething that's important but maybe not\\na virtue uh that that being able to use\\nfrugality I I've written down here I\\nassume you said it because it's in\\nquotes reality isn't a virtue in itself\\nspeed is\\nhow do you think about the balance of of\\nspeed and frugality and the ability to\\nexecute the other thing I think you said\\nthe blast radius of startups is low\\nwhich is to your advantage as a startup\\nyeah I mean frugality\\nfor\\nuh Amazon one of Amazon's core uh like\\nlike Amazon\\nAmazon's leadership principles the Alp\\num one of them is frugality\\num it's about how leaders should be\\nfrugal and\\ninside of Amazon there's a saying about\\nlike yeah yeah frugality but don't you\\ndon't are going to avoid for pity\\num because frugality and frippidity are\\nnear and far aligned\\num\\nbecause you need to be willing to spend\\nmoney\\nand to invest for something that's\\nimportant to do something but also but\\nwasting money is very bad\\nand the difference between one man's\\ninvestment is one man's waste is another\\nman's investment and vice versa\\nthe real thing that kills startups in\\nterms of spending money is usually not\\noverspending on like bandwidth or like\\nserver capacity or like even marketing\\nobviously you don't run marketing it\\ndoesn't work it's inefficient but like\\nwhat uh what kill startups is hiring you\\nhire too many people\\nand that does kill you because you have\\nthis High burn rate and eventually run\\nout of money the burn rate kills you but\\nit also kills you because more people\\nmeans more slow\\num and speed is the essence and like\\nhiring is not in alignment with speed\\num speed isn't alignment with speed and\\nso there is a point where you do need to\\nhire more people to go faster but like\\nit is later than people think it's less\\nhiring than people think and so\\nI think a lot of the advice to startups\\nabout for frugality is really better\\nframed as advice about you need to be\\ngoing fast and that means don't grow\\nyour team too much that creates a lot of\\ndrag\\nwhat what Drew you back to YC as a as a\\npartner now like what was you were at\\nAmazon for a long time what made you\\nwant to I've always wanted to be a YC\\npartner like I uh I don't know if it's\\nlike my forever job but like I watch my\\nfriends go through it I love advising\\nstartups and I was like oh that looks\\nfun I want to try that and so I just\\nalways had the intention of going and\\ndoing YC for a year as a partner\\num just honestly because it's like a\\nlife experience and I'm really enjoying\\nit so far I think there's a chance I do\\nit more ongoing but I also I'm enjoying\\nlike having a little bit more freedom\\npost stopping SEO and the job it's a\\nreal job at YC like you know it's not\\nnot like being a CEO of 2000 company but\\nlike it's a job\\num and so we'll see if it's like the\\nlong-term thing but no I just always\\nwanted to and then once I was free I was\\nlike oh well there's a badge coming up I\\nguess I could go do that and so there's\\nmore of almost more of an Impulse thing\\nless than like a I have some like plan\\nof wanting to do it what do you think's\\nallowed the institution to survive in\\nthe way that that it has uh it's\\nobviously scaled quite a bit over the\\nyears\\num I mean YC is like a uh\\na little like a university yeah uh and\\nlike universities it has a very strong\\nNetwork effect the smart people want to\\nhang out with some other smart people\\nand want to be at the place where the\\nother smart people are and that like\\ncreates a positive feedback cycle that\\nallows it to scale and grow it makes it\\nhard to\\nHarvard was the first University in\\nAmerica weirdly still the most\\nprestigious that's weird like I think\\nYale was the second University founded\\nin America\\nsecond or third most prestigious like\\nthat's weird uh\\nuh I think that exact same Dynamic\\nhappens here and like it's not a and\\nunlike the university is YC is designed\\nto\\nBen can scale up a lot more and so\\nthere's the second place gets is a\\nlittle bit smaller\\num because people can move around more\\nmuch more easily now right if uh if\\nHarvard had been founded in the Nero or\\nanyone could have flown anywhere\\nand had an attitude of scale as much as\\npossible it's not clear there is\\nUniversity 234 immediately\\num\\nand I think YC has been sustained\\nbecause it's\\nalways had a long-term mindset like I\\nremember Paul telling me like saying\\nlike you're two or three and our biggest\\nadvantage in the long run is going to be\\nvery eliminate the Alumni network that's\\nwhat YC is really building and they call\\nthem alumni right it's not\\nthat's that's a different attitude\\num\\nand uh\\nand so he was thinking that far ahead at\\nthe beginning\\nI had another question about YC and I oh\\nwhat do you what do you think the\\nbiggest constraint on startups today the\\nreason that we don't have\\nuh 10 more stripes or a hundred more\\nTwitches or 30 more uh airbnbs is it\\nbecause is it Founders is it ideas is it\\ncapital sufficiently talented people who\\nwho want to take on the pain of starting\\na company yeah like pretty much\\nexclusively there's lots of capital\\navailable\\num\\nI will say there's there's a uh there's\\ndefinitely\\nuh\\nof missing\\nthere's like a few missing gears in that\\nprocess of like there are people who\\nshould get access to the capital and if\\nthey did they would be successful and so\\nthere isn't enough Capital there's\\nplenty of capital there's more than\\nenough Capital but like there's lots of\\npeople who think they should have the\\ncapital many of them are wrong some of\\nthem are right and the system is like\\npretty efficient but there's definitely\\nsome number of people who like\\njust don't get funded and they should\\nbecause they\\nbecause they're bad at pitching because\\nthey don't present\\nbecause because on the surface it looks\\nlooks wrong because because they they\\ncan't show you that they should get the\\nfunding\\num\\nand I think that's a shame and like\\none of YC's mission is to find and fund\\nthose people we can't do it perfectly\\nwere you were you bad at pitching or did\\nyou just hate it I was okay yeah that\\nwasn't great\\num\\nI would be a lot better at pitching now\\nand I think I would enjoy it more uh\\nweirdly at twitch after we sold\\nI I get to practice sales a lot around\\nwith the game game companies and and\\nadvertising and I and also I started\\ninvesting\\nand I uh\\nthere's no way to do this but like if I\\ncould give every founder I should\\nprobably have them like go be an\\ninvestor for two years and then go pitch\\ntheir company because it's suddenly I'm\\nlike oh I see what I was doing wrong\\nlike now I know I've sitting on the\\nother side of the table I'm like oh oh\\nno wonder that person like passed my\\nstartup I was I was explaining it all\\nwrong I didn't understand their\\nincentives I didn't understand how they\\nsaw the world and so the most important\\nthing you can do is a\\nlike\\nI wonder if this would work if I was at\\nif I was to go back and give earlier\\nEmmett advice like how to pitch better\\nwhat I would tell them to do is like go\\nfind some VC who you're friends with who\\nlike sees good companies and be like I\\nwill give dude some due diligence for\\nyou for free\\nif you let me sit in on like\\nyou know a month of pitches and hear the\\ndiscussion afterwards\\nbecause I think I would have been like\\noh I know how to\\nI know how to do this I would have\\nfigured out how to pattern match like\\nthe problem is like starter Founders\\nhave only usually have only seen their\\npitch how do you get good at something\\nthat you've only you've only seen your\\nperformance at you don't know what good\\nlooks like\\num and I think that's the so yeah that's\\nif that's what I would that's what I\\nwould tell my prayers have to go to the\\ninformation's gotten so much better uh\\nabout VC I mean one of the things I I\\nwant to do is try to sort of give\\nelements of how I think or rethink and\\noperating but the pitches it's it's\\nalmost a voodoo science in and of itself\\nAre there specific things that you\\nlearned in pitching the EA or whatever\\nthat you would there's\\num\\nthere's things you can write down that\\npeople have written down a thousand\\ntimes like you know templates and stuff\\nsure\\nthey're all wrong and they're all bad\\nactually you temp pitch templates\\nwhether they're pitches for VC money or\\nlike product things templates are the\\nenemy there's certain like\\naspects you can do but every pitch is\\nunique because it wasn't unique\\nyou don't have any unique Insight like\\nyour company is unique there's a there\\nare generalizable principles and rules\\nbut there's a template you can go off of\\nand so\\nand yet you know it when you see it and\\nthere's like there's there is there's uh\\nI think pitching is one of those things\\nwhere it's uh it's very much medicine\\nyou know that idea the idea of like a\\nskill that you learn through organic\\ndoing\\nthere is no training for pitching\\nthat would be more effective than just\\nlike watching a bunch of pitches and\\nthen the honest brutal discussion\\nafterwards about like whether they think\\nthat's a good idea or not\\nand participating in that\\num\\nand unfortunately I don't think anyone's\\nbrave enough to put\\nthere's no I don't know how the you want\\nto create a piece of content that would\\nbe like incredibly valuable to founder\\nCenter to pitch record three months of\\nevery every partner pitch and every\\npre-partner pitch for every company and\\nthe discussion afterwards and the\\ndecision and publish that\\nand like then edit it down so like you\\ncut out the dead time edit it down and\\njust have people watch that as a as a uh\\nas a uh as a course that would work like\\npeople would get a lot better at\\npitching\\num unfortunately I don't think the\\ncompany should like that I think the\\npartners would be really be awkward but\\nlike\\nyou need to create some system like that\\num because that's the that's the only\\nway to get it's like trying to learn how\\nto like cook from a cookbook you learn\\nto cook in a kitchen\\nyou don't learn to pitch watching a\\nYouTube video you learn to pitch\\nthey're from a PowerPoint you learn to\\npitch in the\\nin the pitching room that's interesting\\nuh shifting gears artificial\\nintelligence\\num I get the feeling you might have some\\nconcerns about the path we're on and\\nsome elements of how things are playing\\nout is that I mean so I guess I have I\\nhave a very specific concern about AI\\nlike generally I'm very Pro technology\\nand I really believe in the sort of like\\nuh\\nthe upside's usually outweigh the\\ndownsides everything's technology can be\\nmisused you should usually wait and you\\nshould wait until you've eventually as\\nwe understand it better\\nyou want to put in regulations but like\\nregulating early is usually a mistake\\nwhen you do do regulation you want to be\\nmaking regulations that are about\\nreducing risk and and for uh Innovation\\nand I actually uh authorizing more\\nInnovation Innovation is usually good\\nfor us\\num\\nI sort of have a very very high level\\nlike syllogism about like AI that I've\\ncome to believe I think is like correct\\nit's like if\\nwe can build if you consider\\nintelligence to be the capacity to solve\\nproblems\\nfrom a given set of resources to a given\\ngoal\\nwe are building things that are more and\\nmore intelligent\\nlike that we've built an intelligence\\nit's kind of amazing actually we built\\nsomething like definitively it may not\\nbe the smartest intelligence but it is\\nunintelligence it can solve problems so\\nwe've built something that can solve\\nproblems like arbitrary problems from\\narbitrary resources\\nand make arbitrary plans\\nat some point as it gets better\\nthe kinds of problems that we'll be able\\nto install\\nsolve will include uh programming chip\\ndesign Material Science uh\\npower production\\num all the things you would need to\\ndesign an artificial intelligence\\nat that point you'll be able to point\\nthe thing we've built back at itself and\\nthis will happen before you get that\\npoint with humans in the loop it already\\nis happening with humans in the loop but\\nthat Loop will get Tighter and Tighter\\nand Tighter\\nand faster and faster and faster until\\nit can fully self-improve itself\\nat which point\\nit will get very fast very quickly\\nand a thing that is very very very smart\\nand you generate something that is very\\ngood very intelligent and by intelligent\\nagain I mean this capacity to solve\\nproblems there's people there's lots of\\nways people that work it's a it's an\\nEnglish word which means it has no one\\ndefinition but I have that in that sense\\nI mean that kind of intelligence\\nand that kind of intelligence is just an\\nintrinsically very dangerous thing\\nbecause intelligence is power human\\nbeings are the dominant form of life on\\nthis planet pretty much entirely because\\nwe're more and smarter than the other\\ncreatures when was the last time\\nintelligence came into you know entity\\nat this level right and within humans I\\nthink people get confused between these\\ntwo different things within the band of\\nhuman intelligence intelligence is not\\nthe most important thing humans have a\\nlot of other attributes but intelligence\\nis a very important thing for people we\\nhave a lot of other gorillas are more\\nintimidating as a species than we are\\nbut Thrillers did not build this studio\\nand humans are like humans are dangerous\\nas hunters for example because we're\\nsmart we do things like you know crowd\\nThe Woolly Mammoth off cliffs and set\\ntraps and like uh\\nuh human be we have we have whites in\\nour irises it's the exact balance uh of\\nwhite to color uh is what communicates\\nwhat we're looking at other primates\\nhave black eyes because they don't want\\nthe other people other creatures to see\\nthem so try not to give away information\\nwe have the white uh around the IRS\\nbecause it lets you tell what other\\npeople are looking at you basically have\\nthis Eerie ability to do it you know\\nexactly what other people are looking at\\nimagine hunting these creatures are\\nhunting you and you see one of them\\nand one of them can like\\nindicates that they want to cross the\\nway that they just saw a deer by like\\nlooking at the deer\\nand there's no Sound Exchange at all\\nit's just purely this like it's like\\nyou're gonna be pretty smart to do like\\nbig very strong theory of mind to do\\nthat\\nif you build something that is a lot\\nsmarter than us not like somewhat\\nsmarter again within humans the smartest\\npeople don't rule the Earth obviously\\num\\nbut like it's much smarter than we are\\nas we are than like dogs right like a a\\nbig jump\\nthat thing is intrinsically pretty\\ndangerous because\\nif it gets set on a goal that isn't that\\nthat uh\\nlike the the the\\ninstrumentals first instrumental\\ninstrumental convergence the first\\ninstrumental step towards achieving that\\ngoal is we'll go first step one if this\\nis easy for you because you're really\\njust that smart well step one just like\\ntake over the planet right like it's\\nlike then I just have control over\\neverything and then and then step two\\nsolve my goal can you define\\ninstrumental convergence for those that\\ndidn't sit through three and a half\\nhours of me talking to Ellie yeah so\\nit's real convergence is this idea that\\nlike uh\\nuh often when you're trying to achieve a\\ngoal step one is to achieve a\\ninstrumental goal along the way it's\\nlike if you want to like for example\\nlike uh\\nuh paper clips is the one yeah yeah so\\nuh no I'm thinking more like an\\ninstrumental instrumental convergence\\nI'm trying to give an example from where\\nit happens to people in their people's\\nlives um oh in chess\\num your actual goal is to Checkmate them\\nbut like along the way to check making\\nthem check making them most the time one\\nof the things you want to do is take\\ntheir pieces now you could not take\\ntheir pieces there's probably I bet a\\nreally a really good chess player\\nagainst the kind of mediocre one could\\nCheckmate them without taking any pieces\\njust like trapping their their but like\\nthat's like even more impressive but\\nlike generally speaking if you're just\\ntrying to\\nwin a game of chess taking their Queen\\ntaking their pawns taking taking their\\npieces is a good idea it like makes it\\neasier to Checkmate them and so I can\\npredict something about almost anyone\\nany good chess player they'll take a\\nbunch of their pieces they'll take the\\nother person's Queen eventually probably\\num in the same way you can predict uh\\nthat corporations uh\\nuh that want to expand into a new market\\nthere's an instrumental goals like step\\none they'll probably hire people in that\\nmarket it's like just predictable\\nand in general if you want to accomplish\\nmost goals like big goals Step One is\\nlike accumulate a lot of money and power\\nlike if you have if you have a goal of\\nuh changing the world\\nit accumulating money and power or\\naccumulating followers who like care\\nlisten to you and will do what you say\\nthese things are like Obviously good\\nfirst steps even if you don't even if\\nyou didn't even know what the next goal\\nwas they would be good first steps and\\nif you know what it is they're\\ndefinitely good for steps\\nstep one if you can achieve it along the\\nway to to achieving any Big Goal yeah\\npaper clips is the traditional one\\num is first just if you if you can pull\\nthis off which like you can't humans\\ncan't do this we don't think of goals\\nlike this because we're not capable\\nenough but if you could pull it off step\\none would be like well first I'm just\\ngonna like\\nliterally just make sure I have total\\ncontrol over everything at all times and\\nthen step two I'll like do whatever it\\nis step two do the thing easy I already\\nhave control over everything no one can\\nstop me I have accessed all the\\nresources simple\\num\\nand I think people just don't it's hard\\nit's hard to people don't imagine\\nsufficiently capable\\nas sufficiently capable\\num\\nand then so then and some people some\\npeople have this idea like oh what if we\\njust don't give it goals well first of\\nall we are giving it goals people are\\nalready building agents but let's just\\nsay we didn't\\nand so you ask this Oracle what's the\\nbest way for me to accomplish goal X\\nand it knows\\nif it takes you literally\\num and it and it it actually answers\\nyour question correctly the answer to\\nyour question\\nwill will be a thing that causes you to\\nbootstrap an AI\\nthat then takes over the world and\\naccomplishes the goal that's the most\\nreliable way to accomplish that goal now\\nI just laid out a chain of argument with\\na lot of if this then this if this then\\nthis if this then this\\nuh I know Eliza thinks that like we're\\nall doomed for sure\\num\\nI buy his Doom argument I buy the chain\\nand the logic I just think that like\\nfirst of all I'm less optimistic with\\nthe current set of technology is going\\nto get to self bootstrapping super\\nintelligence I'm less optimistic than he\\nis that we could officer pessimist\\nwhatever unless I'm not sure than he is\\nthat when it hits that self\\nbootstrapping step that uh that process\\nwill be fast and that we will that there\\naren't\\nimportant new discoveries that will take\\na long time on top of that that we\\nhaven't found I'm less sure that uh\\nuh\\nthis was the idea of alignment getting\\nit you could make the IAI such that it\\nwants the same things we want and then\\nif you ask it to do the thing it won't\\ngo and do horrible things because it's\\nnot dumb and it's aligned and if it\\nwants the same things it knows what you\\nmean it's smart\\nand it has it has aligned goals hooray\\nlike that'll work great I'm Le uh Elijah\\nthinks that we're like just alignments\\nthis incredibly hard problem that like\\nis almost unsolvable more doomed I'm\\nlike not so sure I think it's a more\\nsolvable problem than he thinks it is\\nfor a variety of reasons you know just\\nit would take too long to let go into\\nbut like my my belief is that it's\\neasier\\num\\nand so uh as a result like my P Doom my\\nprobability of Doom is like\\nmy bid ask spread and that's pretty high\\nbecause I have a lot of uncertainty but\\nI would say it's like between\\nlike\\nfive and fifty\\nso there's a wide spread which I think\\nPaul Cristiano Paul Christiano who\\nhandled uh you know a lot of the stuff\\nwithin open AI I think said 25 to 50. it\\nseems like if you if you talk to most AI\\nyeah researchers there's some\\npreponderance of people that's that\\npercentage that should cause you to\\nyour pants but it's human level\\nExtinction I think yeah because no it's\\nnot a human level Extinction it's such\\nextincting humans is bad enough it's\\nlike potential destruction of all value\\nin the light code like like not just for\\nus but for any species caught in the\\nwake of the explosion like\\nuh it's like a universe destroying bomb\\nlike it's really if if if if if if it's\\nreally bad it's bad in a way that's like\\nmakes global warming like not a problem\\nit's bad in a way that makes normal\\nkinds of bad not uh that's not\\nnormally I'm like yeah we'll just roll\\nthe dice it's fine we'll figure it out\\nlater yeah no no like this should go\\nthis is not a figured out later thing\\nthis is like a\\nbig problem southern Manhattan\\nMiami might go underwater like okay okay\\nbut this is we're talking about and so\\nwhy do you think I mean I I it's like\\nsomeone figured out how to invent it a\\nway to make like 10x more powerful\\nFusion Bond bombs out of like sand and\\nbleach\\nthat like could anyone could do at home\\nyeah\\num\\nit's terrifying and and\\nI've had enough time with it now that I\\ncan laugh about it when I first realized\\nit was heart stopping when was\\nthat uh\\nprobably like\\nit's it was it was a dinner I went to\\nbefore\\nwhen opening I was just we had basically\\nright after attention is all you need\\nhad been written like and they sort of\\nrealized the scaling laws were there and\\nI went to a dinner and someone was there\\nand they were talking about it and they\\nwere like I think we were were uh\\nwe actually might be on the path to\\nbuild a general AI attention you all you\\nneed was 2018.\"\n",
      "page_content=\"yeah I think early 2017\\n2017. um\\nand Google paper that yeah\\nand uh and I I heard about the problem I\\nthought about it I just had I'd like I'd\\nbeen like the the AI Doom thing seems\\nplausible whatever like I don't think an\\nAI is coming anytime soon so I'm just\\nnot gonna think about it that hard yet\\nuh\\nand then I was like oh maybe and then I\\nstarted thinking about it harder and\\nthen I was like oh\\noh oh\\num and so uh\\nuh I guess\\nthe the pro I believe the proper\\nresponse is like\\nunfortunately this isn't the kind of\\nthing where\\nuh we can stop forever\\nand it unfortunately is also the kind of\\nthing where like more time is good like\\nI'm actually I'm okay with stretching\\nthe time a little bit but like\\nultimately to solve the problem\\num I think this is one of my biggest\\npoints of Divergence with uh yukowski\\num\\nhe is a mathematician philosopher\\nyou know decision theorist by training I\\nam an engineer\\nam I everything I've ever learned about\\nengineering is the only way you will\\never get something that works if you\\nneed to work on the first try\\nis to build lots of prototypes and\\nmodels at the smaller scale and practice\\nand practice and practice and practice\\nand and trot build start building the\\nthing but like smaller\\nand if there is a world where we survive\\nit is and everything goes wrong where we\\nbuild an AI That's smarter than humans\\nand we survive it it's going to be\\nbecause\\nwe built smaller AIS in that and we\\nactually had lots of as many people\\nsmart people as we can working on that\\nand taking the problem seriously\\nand so I'm I'm generally I'm in favor of\\ntrying to create accounts I've got a\\nfire alarm where we were like like maybe\\nnot AI is bigger than x at some point\\nlike trying to like create a and I\\nactually think there's good reason to\\nbelieve like nobody wants to end the\\nworld and this argument is not that hard\\nto understand\\nand so actually there's good there's a\\ngood option for international\\ncooperation and like treaties about some\\nsort of you know the AI Test Ban 3D\\nabout not bigger than x\\nat some point I don't think I don't\\nthink we're actually at the point where\\nit needs to be not bigger than our the\\ncurrent AIS are just not that smart yet\\nbut I think we should be moving towards\\ncreating that kind of a some kind of\\nsoft I don't we have to figure out what\\nthat looks like because it's it's\\ntrickier to set that than it setting\\nthat rule is way harder than it looks\\nwriting good policy is hard we should be\\nthinking about it now\\nI just think I don't think we're ready\\nfor it yet but in the meantime on these\\nsmaller models we it is good that lots\\nof people are around with them\\nit's good that we have more and more\\npeople trying to figure out how they\\nwork and trying to figure out how you\\ncan make them do things how figuring out\\nhow to make them do bad things\\nthe best way to figure out how to stop a\\nbig AI from doing bad things we'll have\\nthe best way as much it is true\\nthere's a bunch of failure modes for\\nsuper intelligent AIS that don't exist\\nunless super intelligence AIS and we\\nbetter not bet on oh don't worry it\\nworks it works in the dumb ones it'll\\nwork no no that's not how it works you\\ncan't do that but like we will figure it\\nwe are figuring out more and more about\\nthe principles of how it works and if if\\nwe survive it's going to be because that\\nprocess produces a a good generalized\\nunderstanding a good generalized model\\nof how these kinds of predictive models\\nwhich I think includes humans as we are\\nsome kind of very complex predictive\\nmodel\\nwith other stuff too but like that's a\\nbig part of what a human is we'll\\nunderstand how those work at a deeper\\nlevel we'll have some of some science of\\nit actually and that's what we need we\\nneed a science of AIS right now we have\\nan engineering of a highs and no science\\nof AIS and we need to get use the\\nengineering to bootstrap ourselves into\\na science of AIS before we build the\\nsuper intelligent AI\\nso that it doesn't tell us all why do\\nyou think people are struggling with the\\ndiscourse around this like very smart\\npeople seem to abject it's very very\\nobviously mood affiliation rules\\neverything around me\\npeople don't make decisions on a\\nreasoning basis I mean myself included\\nmost of the time I happen to like\\nI happen to\\nfind this problem interesting and\\ncompelling on its own so I spent a lot\\nof time like digging into the arguments\\nthemselves because I was like drawn to\\nit but like most of the time I make\\ndecisions the same way as everyone else\\ndoes the person pitches me on pitching\\nme on the Flat Earth thing who's saying\\nthat like a bunch of things I don't\\nreally like listen to them I just like\\nI can they say some things and it\\ntriggers like oh you're part of that\\ntribe those people generally I don't\\nthink think very clearly I'm just gonna\\ndiscount everything you're saying and\\nignore you yeah Robin Hansen talks about\\n9 11 people and it's like you don't\\nargue with them you just sort of move on\\nyeah conversation and the AI people\\nsound like\\nuh religious nuts who are telling you\\nabout the end of the Doomsday into the\\nworld and it sadly pattern matches\\nreally nicely right like the AI is like\\nthe you know it's like the Antichrist\\nit's coming and you know if what if\\nwe're good the good AI will come and\\nsave us from that if it's like it sounds\\nlike like\\nuh\\nChristian rapturists yes\\num Last of Us yeah it uh unfortunately\\num reasoning from fictional evidence is\\nit doesn't work and that mood\\naffiliation reminds me of this is not an\\nargument and the Earth is not round\\nbecause the flat earthers sound crazy\\nthe Earth is round because you can\\ndemonstrably\\nsee that the Earth is round and go\\nmeasure that yourself and it's true\\nand if you make decisions\\nbased on anyone who's telling you that\\ndoing X will unleash a force which is\\ngoing to kill us all they sound like a\\nbunch of\\nuh crazy religious people because it's\\nnever happened before it's never\\nhappened before guaranteed guaranteed\\nthe first time that's true we're all\\ndead because your algorithm always\\npredicts the same thing you know the\\nthing you're going through in your head\\nalways predicts the same outcome for\\nanyone who is predicting Doom from\\ncreating a powerful force Beyond human\\nability now\\nit is true you should be skeptical in\\ngeneral when someone proposes that\\nbecause there are a lot there are\\nInfinity examples from the past three\\nyou know six thousand years of history\\nof people predicting that falsely about\\nthings\\nand and people\\npeople made imaginary cures for medicine\\nmedicinal cures for like tinctures that\\nwere supposed to cure you for a very\\nvery long time and then we made one that\\nworked\\nand and you just can't reason that way\\nsometimes sometimes it's new sometimes\\nit's not like before usually it's like\\nbefore and sometimes it's not and I I am\\npersonally convinced this time it is not\\nlike before and I encourage everyone\\nwho's in that mode like\\nthe main thing that what I want you to\\npay attention to is listen to me like\\npeople like me listen to people like uh\\neven utkowski who I disagree with when\\nthe amount of Doom but we're like\\npro-cryonics Pro technology like\\ntechnology is going to fix all our\\nproblems crazies like if I if I have a\\nif I have a defect it's that I am too\\nPro technology I want too little\\nregulation like are you doing Ionix by\\nthe way I have not signed up yet I\\nreally should I've been it's one of\\nthose things on my to-do list I'm\\nfailing the rationality test yes um\\nuh but uh but you're a techno Optimist\\nI'm a techno Optimist and like and most\\nof you should notice that the people the\\npeople who are affected by this\\nparticular one\\nare not like the people who generally\\npredict we're not Paul airlock is full\\nof on like oh the Doom is coming\\nthe population bomb he is wrong and\\nweirdly so and refuses to learn from his\\nlesson that he's wrong again he's wrong\\nover and over again\\nthis is not like that\\nlike I am not panicked about global\\nwarming I think I think alarming is a\\nreal thing I don't want to say like I\\ndon't want anyone to walk away thinking\\nlike I think isn't real but like I\\nbelieve I I believe in technology the\\nengineers will figure it out don't worry\\nit's gonna be fine I'm not quite sure\\num it might have some well depending on\\nwhether we play to have the political to\\nget around to it quickly or not it might\\nhave more or less dire consequences but\\nlike we will figure it out eventually it\\nwill be fine we will figure we will get\\nthis I do and it's okay so here here I\\nam being the guy who's like the Techno\\nOptimist and I am like no no the AI I\\nthink that this thing though actually\\nmaybe may be a problem and I think if\\nyou're if you are rejecting it because\\nwe sound like a bunch of crazy it's just\\nnotice that like at least a some number\\nof people who are worried about this\\nare not are on your I'm on your team I'm\\non the Techno Optimus team\\nreally\\nthink and it and it's not it's not\\nobvious why it's true it takes a good\\ndeal of Engagement with the material to\\nsee why it's true because at first\\nat first it seems like it shouldn't be\\nthat big of a deal it shouldn't be that\\nbig of a problem but then the more you\\ndig in then we realize like oh well\\nactually but wait a second\\nand it is and so like I just encourage\\npeople to engage with the technical\\nmerits of the argument and I\\nalways welcome people to come to to you\\nknow ask questions but also like if you\\nwant to debate\\nno no I have an idea we can align it\\nthis way do this and it will create a\\nyou know it will create the AI that like\\ncares about things we care about we want\\nyour ideas like that's great let's have\\nan argument about that self-improvement\\nwon't work\\nokay if no because like people have said\\nself-improvement will work in the past\\nand it never did then I don't want to\\nhear it because whatever it's not a real\\nargument but if you have an actual\\nlike argument about how the current\\nlearning techniques won't work for that\\nfor some\\nreason engineering reason\\nabsolutely let's talk about it well I'm\\nglad we spent all this time building\\nyour credibility as a normal person just\\ngo off the rails here but but seriously\\nI mean it's uh it is something that\\npeople are like genuinely concerned\\nabout and there's no incentive you have\\nMark Andreessen published something\\nrecently about like Ai and he had a\\nbunch of different points against it but\\nthe AI killing everyone point was the\\nfirst one and I I think it went back to\\na lot of discourse around people that\\nprofit from this is their business and\\nthis is how they make money and\\ntherefore that's what why they're\\nintended to communicate in this way you\\nare not I I as far as I know your\\nbusiness is not in Dooms uh doomsday\\nscenario planning around AI I have no\\nFinancial stake in in either doomsday or\\nplanning around AI or the other weird\\nlike double think 40 chess thing people\\nimpute to uh it is like oh we're\\nactually trying to build up open Ai and\\nanthropic as being and Google as being\\nlike super powerful and it's on ego\\nthing about making talking about how\\namazingly great this stuff is so we can\\nlike raise more money for opening and\\nRegulatory capture yeah yeah and like\\nlike I don't own any equity in any of\\nthese things you're not trying to help\\nyour 2006 batch made 2005 batchmates no\\nhe's he's Sam Hunt's really good at\\nraising money like he does not need my\\nhelp yes I promise yeah what would you\\nrecommend to people I mean uh if they\\nare curious about all of this stuff and\\nlike I I when people ask me about it\\nbecause I've had Eliezer on they're like\\nso now what and they're like ah you know\\ncall your Congressman I don't know so\\nthere's sort of two paths that you can\\nwhere you can contribute if you care\\nabout this problem one is um\\nif you're Technical and you're\\ntechnically minded\\num and you think that you uh\\nbut you want to work on it like go learn\\nhow the AIS work and work on\\ninterpretability\\nand work on uh courage ability and can\\nyou define those terms so durability is\\nlike understanding what's going on\\ninside the AI which we are very little\\nunderstanding right of right now yeah\\nand ability is is how do you make a\\ndecision making\\nthing that is willing to be corrected\\nby others\\nbut he's actually and that's sort of\\nthat's where Eliza has a lot to say\\nabout this he's kind of a decision\\nTheory thing how do you get it to sort\\nof like believe that\\neven though everything it knows seems\\nlike this is the best way of doing it\\nthe other or telling me that's not right\\nand so I'm open to being corrected by\\ntheir point of view how do you make it\\nsort of this how do you how do you give\\nsomething humility almost in a way right\\num and and we have no idea to do that\\neither\\num we've made some we've had more\\nprogress on interpretability than\\ncourage ability but\\nmade a little bit of progress on both\\nand we're making more on\\ninterpretability and\\nwhat the my real pitch for this is it's\\nactually really interesting there's just\\nstuff lying around that no one's checked\\nno one's tried it's like uh when the\\nmicroscope was invented and suddenly\\nlike you could just make a scientific\\ncareer by like pointing microscopes at\\nthings and like there were like lots of\\nthings to point the microscope out that\\nno one had ever looked at before\\nwe have a mind you can go look at and\\nexamine and experiment with I've never\\nhad one of those before and so there's a\\nbunch of like interesting kind of like\\nscientific workers I would encourage\\npeople to go do scientific work on AIS\\ngo take the AIS other people have built\\nand then the engineering and try to see\\nwhat science you can do to them\\nparticularly around interpreting what's\\ngoing on inside them or how you get them\\nto accept corrective feedback\\num\\nif you're more if you're not technically\\nminded and you don't feel like learning\\nhow to like actually build a Transformer\\num\\nthey you have there's less obvious how\\nyou contribute directly but uh\\nI think mostly like\\nuh\\nhelping correct the debate and correct\\nthe tone of the discussion because this\\nlike the super intelligent AI must kill\\nit might kill everyone thing gets\\nwrapped together with a bunch of other\\nconcerns about AI that are real they're\\ntheir things but they're like normal\\nconcerns like\\nwill it just cause discrimination job\\nloss what's called job loss like I know\\nthat let\\nthat stuff's all like a thing but like\\nhonestly on those things I sort of feel\\nabout it the way I feel about most\\nregulation we're like\\nyou know like it's a little early\\nprobably there probably will be a good\\nregulation to write we don't know what\\nit looks like the area is evolving so\\nfast very hard to write good good\\nregulation\\ndon't let that get confused\\num job loss doesn't kill everyone yeah\\nso there's so there's there's AI ethics\\nand there's then there's AI not kill\\neveryone ism\\nand\\nthe ad not kill everyone thing is like\\nwe need the AI to not kill everyone\\ndon't let people mush it together when\\nyou see hear people conflating the two\\ncorrect the record uh because they're\\njust not the same idea\\num and they're the same kind of problem\\nand they won't be solved with the same\\nkind of tools and uh\\nuh\\nthe danger is that those two get sort of\\nwrapped together into some\\nthing again gets rejected by people who\\njust like well I don't who rejects the\\nsafety AI safety aif ethics stuff that\\nthey it's like well this doesn't really\\nmake sense which I kind of agree with a\\nlot of the people who say like most that\\nstuff kind of doesn't make sense to me I\\ncould see a theory maybe some of it um\\nwe will throw out the the good part with\\nthe bad and a lot of that other stuff is\\ntrue of almost any technology right yeah\\nthat stuff is just general it's General\\ntechnological like and that's my thing\\nof why I think Silicon Valley in\\nparticular has has struggled to talk\\nabout this and I don't even know what my\\nfully formed opinions are on this stuff\\nbut it's that for a long time Silicon\\nValley has been accused of all the\\nnegative externalities that are going to\\ncome from uh whatever the technology is\\nthat we've integrated around and so\\neveryone's very used to being defensive\\nabout like oh job loss yeah\\neveryone's on the on the defense against\\nanything critical like sort of broadly\\ncritical of new technologies because it\\npattern matches to a bunch of people who\\ngo around throwing up check throwing\\nchaff in the air attacking everything\\nall the time even when it doesn't really\\nmake any sense\\nand so it's easy to slot it into that\\nthe slot the whole thing into that thing\\nand just you know\\nthrow it away and I just think like\\nuh\\nthe uh there's there's a piece of that\\nthat is different than the normal than\\nthe norm it's hard Verity mood\\naffiliation drives most of our decision\\nmaking and it's hard to get people to\\nnotice that\\nI have three more questions how are you\\non uh time can we keep going time is it\\nwe're almost at 30 so we're way overtime\\num\\nwhat's my calendar here\\num\\noh I have to meet my friend uh let me\\njust text my friend real quick okay\\num these won't be nearly as long as AI\\nethics\\nall right all right\\num\\nthere's a graphic you tweeted out about\\nincome that you said you keep handy for\\ndinner parties uh why do you keep that\\ngraphic we'll show it on screen as we're\\ntalking but why do you find that graphic\\nso interesting\\num\\nit shows I think on a more optimistic\\nnote than the one we were just on there\\nyeah yeah it it shows so first of all\\nthe fundamentally what it shows is in\\ngeneral people getting much richer\\nhouseholds getting much richer and\\nspecific\\num\\nhouse you know\\nthe the almost all of it is the the bulk\\nof this curve moving down and that the\\nbig spike on the right isn't a small\\nnumber of people getting much wealthier\\nit's\\na lot more people making 200 that more\\nthan 200 000 a year like eight percent\\nof the population and for people\\nlistening it's like a distribution since\\n1970 or something of income and maybe a\\nFamily household income in real terms\\nand in real terms and so it slides from\\nlike a you know sliding kind of smiling\\ngraph to being much more on the 200k\\nplus side of the axis and but the other\\nthing that happens is it goes from being\\na pretty defined like bell curve to like\\nthis weird like almost like exponential\\ndecay shape like there's still a lump in\\nthe bell curve area but like it's less\\nand less a bell curve and more and more\\nflat like an exponential decay curve of\\npeople making every bucket people makes\\nthere are slightly fewer people in the\\nbucket but actually there's about as\\nmany people in forty thousand 30 to 40\\nas there are in 50 to 60 as there are 60\\nto 70 as they're already 70 to 80. it's\\nactually the main story is the\\nflattening\\nof the distribution\\nand what that flattening means is it\\nused to be there was a normal income\\nuh normal household income was 30 35 000\\na year and if you're within and some\\npeople made a little bit more and some\\npeople made a little bit less but\\nfor the most part everyone was in the\\nmode they had they made there was a real\\nmodal income the there was a most common\\nincome\\nand most people made relatively close\\nalmost everyone made relatively close to\\nthat that amount of money\\nand what has been happening and then you\\nhad some number of very rich people and\\nlike medium rich people but like the\\nbulk of society was in that thing and\\nwhat's been happening is\\nuh\\nthere isn't really a norm anymore we've\\ndestroyed the norm and instead there's\\njust\\nsome people made a lot more money some\\npeople made a lot a lot more money some\\npeople made a medium amount more money\\nsome people made a little more money\\nbut like in general uh\\neveryone's do making like uh everyone's\\nmaking more but the the\\nthere isn't a it's hard everyone at can\\nnow look to the person the left and the\\nperson on the right there's like lots of\\npeople making a lot more money than me\\nand lots of people making a lot less\\nmoney than me for most people\\nand that feels bad it feels like\\ninequality it also is inequality\\nactually but but everyone's getting\\nricher which is good and yet somehow\\nit's this flattening that creates a\\nsense of like being left behind and\\nI don't quite know what to do about it\\nbecause it's a it's a very optimistic\\nstory on the one hand of like\\nAmerican households generally getting\\nmuch wealthier and many many more people\\nhaving access to more uh resources which\\nis good that's the good that we'd like\\nthat\\num there is a slight Spike at the very\\nbottom of people with almost nothing I\\nthink that's that is that's also an\\nissue\\num\\nand it's not to say there aren't any\\nissues in our society like you know\\nobviously Healthcare education\\num housing all cost you much but\\nlike the the real\\nuh\\nunderlying thing that bothers people\\nthat that on the other side of like this\\nthis flattening out I'm not quite sure\\nhow you\\nhow do you how do you how do you fix\\nthat without like making everyone really\\npoor there's an easy way to fix it make\\neverybody poor\\ngo back everyone take it take a bunch of\\nmoney for everybody it's easy to break\\nthings it's easy to make people more\\npoor um and so\\nI think a big part of what happens there\\nis as it's you get spread out more you\\nhave the the housing in the middle\\num the people in the middle can't afford\\nthings that get bit if there's a good\\nthat gets where there's a limited Supply\\nand it's getting bit up and you make\\nyou're making more money on that\\nparticular good you are screwed and that\\nsounds a lot like education and housing\\nto me um and so I think that's a that's\\na big part of why it feels so bad for\\npeople\\num which is why I care so much about\\ngetting more housing made making\\neducation more available I think these\\nthese things are very important\\nyou recently turned 40 and you did a Tim\\nUrban ish layout of your life and time\\nspent doing that exercise was it on a\\nweekly basis yeah every week yeah every\\nweek\\ndid an internalization of turning 40 and\\nlaying graphically out how you spent\\nyour time did were there any takeaways\\nfrom from that that you\\nI mean I kind of I knew the story\\nalready yeah um\\nit was just kind of cool to see it all\\nlaid out\\num and uh\\nI guess my biggest takeaway was man I\\nspent a long time in school yeah it's\\nbeen a really long time like maybe\\nlonger than I needed to like maybe I\\ncould have started working earlier in\\nretrospect yeah uh that was not that\\nmany surprises it was fun though it's\\nlike fun to encourage everyone to do it\\nit's fun to lay your life out like that\\nand take a look at it you live in San\\nFrancisco are you optimistic about San\\nFrancisco absolutely the city is uh\\ndoing doing much better than it was\\nduring covet Cove is very hard in San\\nFrancisco I think\\num\\nwe have problems\\num you know the fentanyl crisis is\\nreally real people are dying in the\\nstreets it's like not okay\\num\\nbut we also have a lot of really big\\nadvantages\\num and there's a lot of good happening\\nin the city too and I'm uh\\nI think I'm most encouraged by the\\nnumber of people I know who\\nuh have built their careers and their\\nlives here and who are committed to the\\ncity and who are\\nnot leaving and they're planning to do\\nthe work to try to make San Francisco\\nbetter place where it's you know\\nthe core things that everybody cares\\nabout right like you shouldn't be people\\nwho\\ndon't have anywhere to live dying on the\\nstreets uh there shouldn't be obvious\\nrampant crime people being victimized by\\nthat uh left and right uh there\\nshouldn't be housing shouldn't be so\\nexpensive that like you have to be rich\\nto have access to it\\num\\nthere should be better Transit options\\nfor people um they don't they don't want\\nthem stuck in traffic like the park we\\nhave more and better Parks like I don't\\nknow there's none of these things are\\ncontroversial and in fact I wouldn't\\neven say any of these things are\\nuh things that we want we don't\\nall we don't have wide agreement that we\\nshould go do\\num\\nit's a matter of I think that I pretty\\nstrongly disagree with many of the\\npeople who but what will cause the\\noutcome but I think the good news is\\nwe're all aligned on wanting the same\\nthings and so it's just a matter of\\ngetting the right plan in place for the\\nright people executing it\\num and these kinds of changes are not uh\\nstartups are all about speed\\num politics and government policy is all\\nabout consistency\\nand so that's that's sort of where my\\nfocus is just you know keep keep turning\\nthe wheel last one before I let you go\\nwhat's what's a piece of conventional\\nSilicon Valley wisdom that you\\nwholeheartedly disagree with or think\\npeople get wrong\\nthe the most of the wholehearted wisdom\\nin Silicon Valley is 100 correct for\\ncertain people in certain context and\\n100 wrong for other people in other\\ncontexts and trying to come up with a\\npiece of advice that's always wrong is\\nlike\\npretty hard\\num because like that's you know advice\\nis over generalization and so\\nit almost always is true in some context\\num what about proportionally gets said\\nyeah a lot and like is is should be said\\nrelatively is usually not right\\num\\noh I I know uh startups hire a players\\nstartups should not be trying to hire\\nany players I mean you can be trying if\\nyou want you're not you're lying to\\nyourself uh you don't know what an a\\nplayer looks like if you did they\\nwouldn't work for you\\num you might be an a player because you\\nlike the founding team like might be a\\nplayers potentially you hope you hope\\nyou are that's your goal but like and\\nyou might hire some a players because\\nyou attract them and they like believe\\nin the mission I'm not saying you never\\nhire an a player but they think you're\\ngonna hire all a players I mean come on\\nno you're not that's just like a lie and\\nand\\nthat's okay\\nand this idea that you can separate\\npeople and sort of a players and B\\nplayers anyways I know what people mean\\nby it it's like you want to hire like\\nthe most talented people in the entire\\nworld but actually what you really want\\nto hire are talented people who will\\nwork hard and believe in the mission and\\nwho want to work for you\\nand like there are a lot of those people\\nand you should go hire them\\num and\\nuh\\nand that that that idea is like a sort\\nof toxic Elite idea that like I think I\\njust think is ridiculous like that's you\\ncan't do it and you shouldn't try\\nmost of the time and then you have\\ncompanies\\num that are on the very very Cutting\\nEdge of Technology where\\nyou better hire pretty much all a\\nplayers you're gonna die and\\nyou have to hire very slowly Renaissance\\nTechnologies it's basically Renaissance\\ntechnology is a hedge fund that actually\\nhires only like you have to have\\npublished multiple groundbreaking math\\npapers before they'll like they'll hire\\nyou like in statistics like they're not\\njoking around they're actually hiring a\\nplayers it might be the most interesting\\nbusiness in the world or at least on a\\nvery short list yeah yeah and but like\\nyou're not rentac yeah don't kick\\nyourself yeah yeah good well Emmett\\nthanks for doing this thank you everyone\\n[Music]\\n[Applause]\\nforeign\\n\"\n"
