[[0]]all data comes from the same place which
[[3.56]]is the past but if the future looks
[[6.52]]different from the past your data is
[[9.6]]completely useless the biggest risk of
[[12.96]]raising too much money is you just lose
[[16.32]]discipline I've never seen a company
[[19.88]]successfully raise a bunch of money and
[[23.08]]not start spending it in ways that
[[26.12]]aren't actually very smart my advice
[[28.92]]would be like if you raise a lot of
[[31.44]]money you should immediately the next
[[35.68]]day do a the goal of a culture is to
[[40.24]]drive velocity you got to have trust
[[43.48]]which means people doing what they say
[[46.68]]putting the issues on the table we have
[[50.4]]an open channel in our slack instance
[[53.92]]where anybody can ask the leadership
[[57.2]]team a question and I think that builds
[[60.96]]trust we're at an interesting moment
[[64.28]]right now where globalization is in
[[67.36]]question like whether or not will we
[[70.92]]just produce everything domestically how
[[74.16]]do you think about the future for trade
[[77.6]]with China China has a few advantages
[[81.68]]that we don't have China believes
[[87.04]]in Ryan I am so excited for this I can't
[[92.04]]believe how long it's been since our
[[96.12]]last show I was I was young when we last
[[100.84]]did a show so thank you for joining me
[[106.44]]today oh my pleasure they me backr not
[[111.52]]at all but I want to start with a bit of
[[115.12]]a weird one but I find it actually quite
[[118.52]]informative think back to when you were
[[122.28]]young you and your bro growing up what
[[125.88]]did you want to be when you were growing
[[130.72]]up ran oh wow I don't think I ever had
[[135.8]]that many Ambitions I don't remember to
[[138.96]]be
[[142.48]]honest did someone tell you did my
[[145.68]]brother tell you what I wanted to be I
[[148.64]]don't remember no I'm just always
[[152.76]]fascinated by it but I think it's always
[[156.56]]indicative did you know that you would
[[161.24]]be successful no I don't think so I
[[167.08]]spent a lot of my time learning
[[172.44]]languages when I was younger and I would
[[177.48]]likeed Adventure you know I wanted to
[[182.12]]get out there my favorite uh kids book
[[186.96]]was always Curious George want to get
[[190.48]]out there and see what's happening in
[[193.24]]the world go some go some Adventures
[[197.16]]caus some trouble so yeah s uh you know
[[201.16]]I lived in lived in like five countries
[[206.48]]before I was 24 something uh learned how
[[212.72]]to speak Spanish Portuguese Chinese
[[217.8]]little French but uh it was all just in
[[221.44]]the spirit of Adventure I don't think I
[[225.0]]had like longer term ambition than so
[[228.48]]got into working for my brother and
[[231.24]]doing business in the spirit of
[[235.48]]Adventure that takes you to China and
[[241.0]]reselling scooters motorbikes how does
[[246.28]]that lead to flag Sport with your bro 20
[[251.68]]years ago early 2000s we my brother I I
[[255.56]]started work for my brother when I
[[258.4]]graduated from college and we built this
[[262.64]]company buying motorcycles off-road
[[268.56]]vehicles dirt bikes ATVs dune buggies
[[273.4]]and selling them through the internet
[[276.4]]and it was really a technology company
[[279.48]]like we didn't Market ourselves that way
[[283.56]]but it was before Shopify and strip and
[[287.68]]we had to build our own inventory
[[291.36]]management systems and accounting and it
[[295.88]]was in the browser like in the late
[[299.04]]early
[[302.32]]2000s um so you know we should have
[[307.0]]built like a software company and sold
[[310.8]]the software instead we kind of sold
[[314.44]]this motorcycles but we learned a ton
[[319.16]]about import export and about how
[[323.16]]difficult it was to work with the great
[[325.92]]foring and logistics companies in the
[[329.08]]world both because of a lack of
[[333.16]]Technology like fundamentally I mean 20
[[337.2]]years ago there was just nothing the the
[[340.64]]truck trucking side we could 20 years
[[344.96]]ago log in to platforms and gets rates
[[348.92]]uh and we built a lot of automation
[[352.24]]around that but the the inbound side the
[[356.16]]import of containers and Air Freight
[[359.28]]like just nothing we couldn't get
[[362.72]]anything and then two I felt like the
[[367.16]]freight forwarding industry just really
[[371.56]]didn't wasn't easy to work with they
[[374.92]]didn't want to see the world through my
[[378.36]]eyes and help me as an entrepreneur to
[[382.0]]build my business there's a lot of
[[386.16]]Arcane terminology kind of code words
[[390.56]]acronyms
[[394.64]]and now my working model is these are
[[398.76]]rookie detectors so they can figure out
[[402.52]]whether or not I know anything and if I
[[406.48]]can't they can charge me a lot of money
[[410.24]]um but we wanted to build a company that
[[414.08]]kind of like makes it simple to
[[417.84]]understand import boort helps you and we
[[421.28]]want to make money but we'll do that by
[[425.28]]helping you grow your business um and
[[430.52]]and using technology to make things easy
[[434.88]]so yeah it really came out of like a
[[438.12]]frustration as a customer feeling like
[[441.6]]man these companies are like they make a
[[444.92]]lot of money they're good businesses but
[[448.76]]they just aren't very easy to work with
[[452.68]]uh and both Tech and a culture of
[[455.64]]customer engagement can make it a lot
[[459.2]]better no I I totally get that sometimes
[[463.0]]sounds like quite a lot of tech Founders
[[465.68]]to be
[[470.44]]honest um I do have to ask you know I I
[[475.44]]spoke to many of our mutual friends
[[479.24]]before the show and they said ask about
[[484.8]]the time slightly away from being CEO
[[490.96]]and your Reflections on that time you
[[495.52]]were CEO for so many years and then you
[[499.48]]had a little bit of time away how did
[[504.36]]you that time and how did you reflect on
[[509.24]]your life and flex board in that period
[[512.96]]I wasn't really a way I was the chairman
[[515.72]]of the board for Flex board so I was
[[518.92]]less involved I was more of a board
[[522.88]]member I would say I spent a lot of time
[[526.04]]well I did spent a lot of time with my
[[529.04]]family I've got two young kids um and a
[[532.16]]wonderful wife so spent a lot of time
[[535.44]]with the family I I think the the time
[[539.32]]to reflect and really think about the
[[542.44]]business from first principles as an
[[545.72]]investor was really valuable I became an
[[549.04]]investor I joined Founders fund as a
[[552.96]]partner uh and which is like one of the
[[557.84]]top VC funds in the world and and so I
[[561.72]]looked at a lot of businesses and I
[[564.52]]started looking at flexport from the
[[567.8]]mindset of an investor rather than a
[[571.08]]Founder I think that was actually really
[[573.76]]healthy to kind of step back and look
[[577.8]]and look at the p&l look at the business
[[582.52]]model think a little bit more clear
[[586.16]]added about where we are you know you're
[[589.72]]in the business every day it's a little
[[593.68]]bit hard to step back did you see it
[[597.2]]differently when you looked at it as an
[[601.4]]investor through that lens yeah I did I
[[606.52]]did I think um looking at it from my
[[610.52]]sort of a balance sheet perspective
[[614.48]]return on assets return on Capital
[[618.56]]return on invested Capital how do you
[[621.96]]think about uh what kinds of return on
[[625.12]]Capital do you want to generate how
[[627.92]]should you reinvest profits how do you
[[631.12]]generate profit and then reinvest it in
[[635.88]]ways that compound and yeah more like an
[[640.48]]Investor's had rather than a Founder we
[[644.2]]just like build build build solve
[[647.84]]problems and build and the investor can
[[651.24]]take a step back and like look at the
[[655.28]]company without even looking deep into
[[658.84]]the company just by reading the the
[[661.48]]income statement and balance sheet and
[[664.04]]those are kinds of things like bounders
[[667.12]]need to do way more often is like really
[[670.56]]live in reality and and sit down with
[[673.84]]their business and look at it the way an
[[678.0]]investor look at it did you take those
[[683.08]]Reflections into how you act as CEO
[[688.52]]today like have you kept that lens and
[[694.08]]applied those Reflections into how your
[[699.6]]action plan is today for sure yeah I
[[704.48]]mean I came back to the company about
[[708.32]]two months ago first thing you know I
[[711.44]]come back with basically three things
[[714.36]]now I'm not saying oh I come back as an
[[718.16]]investor I do there are some aspects of
[[721.84]]what I'm doing right now that feel a bit
[[724.72]]like private Equity have come in and you
[[728.76]]know run a tight ship we cut 27% of our
[[733.72]]costs already in my first five weeks uh
[[737.72]]we've got a road map to to get the
[[740.96]]company profitable by next year by the
[[744.2]]end of next year without raising prices
[[747.04]]for our customers so that's super
[[749.28]]important but that's not the most
[[751.76]]important thing I'm doing actually the
[[754.36]]most important thing I'm doing right now
[[757.44]]is actually as not not something an
[[760.52]]investor would do it's really about the
[[763.72]]culture of the company and driving a
[[767.16]]culture where our leadership starting
[[769.92]]with me but all of the people in
[[773.0]]leadership at the company are way more
[[777.08]]in tune with our customers and with the
[[780.76]]people that serve the customers like
[[783.68]]spending way more time on the front
[[788.36]]lines um getting to know the customer
[[792.64]]getting to know the problems that
[[795.48]]customers have whether that's a problem
[[798.8]]with how we operate but more often it's
[[802.2]]a problem out there in the world of
[[806.16]]supply chain and how do we solve that
[[809.72]]and then I can't meet all the customers
[[813.64]]I've done 115 customer calls in the
[[818.52]]first eight weeks on the job um try to
[[824.04]]do four or five every single day the um
[[828.8]]I can't meet all the customers but I can
[[832.24]]meet all the teams that are meeting the
[[836.36]]customers and synthesize that feedback
[[839.92]]and make sure we're actually addressing
[[842.84]]all the key issues that are that are out
[[846.12]]there and so yeah that's that's that's
[[848.8]]probably the most important thing I'm
[[850.96]]doing even though it gets more headlines
[[853.88]]say I'm cleaning up by cutting cost and
[[856.96]]stuff like this when you look at those
[[860.68]]115 calls what have been your biggest
[[864.88]]lessons from doing them well customers
[[868.48]]really like flexb they they want us to
[[871.72]]succeed they love our vision they love
[[874.72]]what we stand for they love our people
[[878.2]]and they love they love our products
[[881.48]]they've given us a lot of feedback of
[[885.04]]areas of like oh you know the biggest
[[888.88]]things in logistics are on Time
[[892.0]]Performance
[[897.56]]cost and accur accy of data and they've
[[903.2]]given us a lot of feedback of areas that
[[905.96]]you're like hey you guys need to do
[[908.44]]better on this or that thing and it's
[[911.48]]great because it lines up with exactly
[[915.0]]our road maps and where we're focused on
[[918.6]]so that's been like confirmatory I
[[921.72]]learned something in every call the
[[924.0]]other things I learned is how much
[[927.36]]customers like flexb capital flexport
[[931.56]]capital is our our inventory financing
[[934.92]]product we Finance the inventory as it's
[[939.04]]traveling through Logistics networks uh
[[944.36]]and customers who use that are super
[[948.36]]happy with flexx work because we're
[[950.88]]giving them money and financing their
[[953.96]]business which isn't surprising but they
[[957.24]]also become more profitable too so it's
[[961.0]]just like a huge win-win they become
[[965.64]]stickier you know help them grow they
[[970.0]]grow more that was a little surprising I
[[973.8]]didn't know how the C capital I had
[[976.88]]spend enough time with all the capital
[[980.04]]customers but they they definitely stand
[[983.72]]out as being happier customers we're
[[987.04]]gonna unpack quite a lot of what you
[[990.28]]just said there I I do want to start
[[993.6]]more around you and your leadership
[[996.92]]actually Ryan and it's something that I
[[1000.0]]want to start with which is quality
[[1003.32]]versus efficiency can you talk to me
[[1007.0]]about how you view the two and the
[[1010.32]]relationship between quality and
[[1013.6]]efficiency yeah you know I don't know if
[[1016.52]]this is true for company in the world
[[1020.12]]but it is it is the absolute truth in
[[1023.96]]logistics is that almost all
[[1027.68]]inefficiency comes from bad quality Bri
[[1031.4]]prac what is bad quality mean something
[[1034.32]]was late it was shipped to the wrong
[[1037.56]]address you Ed the wrong Customs
[[1041.72]]classification code or you cleared it
[[1045.24]]through customs when it should have
[[1047.68]]traveled through that country without
[[1051.24]]clearing customs onto the next country
[[1055.6]]call that an in bond shipment a mistake
[[1059.08]]like that will cost you all your
[[1062.84]]efficiency gains for the month you know
[[1066.6]]one mistake because it takes weeks to
[[1070.2]]unwind things and the penalties and and
[[1074.08]]you can't you can never quantify the
[[1078.44]]lack of loss of trust that a mistake
[[1082.48]]like that will will bring to your
[[1085.72]]customer it's very ironic that the more
[[1089.36]]a company and Logistics focuses on
[[1093.44]]efficiency the less efficient efficient
[[1097.76]]they'll get and the more they focus on
[[1101.68]]quality the lower their cost will be the
[[1105.08]]the more efficient they'll be uh it's
[[1107.8]]not it's counterintuitive it's not
[[1111.36]]obvious at all although if you read a
[[1115.56]]lot of literature of um you know the
[[1119.4]]Great American Business philosophers we
[[1123.24]]Deming and he's known as like the
[[1126.64]]grandfather of quality or something like
[[1129.64]]that and you read his stuff you're like
[[1133.04]]yeah none of this is surprising that's
[[1136.48]]been known it's like the heart of the
[[1140.68]]Toyota production system uh it's a heart
[[1145.44]]of like a lot of different philosophies
[[1149.72]]on how to drive quality the goal is my
[[1153.6]]favorite sort of Business book and it's
[[1157.04]]all about theory of constraints and
[[1161.04]]driving um driving quality so that you
[[1165.44]]don't have to do rework and eliminate
[[1169.92]]waste as you go um and so yeah that's
[[1174.36]]like our Obsession right now is on time
[[1179.32]]performance accurate Milestone data
[[1183.92]]making sure the invoice what we charge
[[1187.76]]you is very close to what we originally
[[1192.12]]quoted you ideally matching it although
[[1196.04]]things happen in the world yeah so
[[1198.64]]that's our Obsession right now is
[[1201.8]]driving quality Ryan do you think that
[[1205.92]]the best CEOs are the best resource
[[1209.96]]allocators it's commonly said as a kind
[[1214.24]]of throwaway phrase do you think the
[[1217.84]]best CEOs are the best resource
[[1220.92]]allocators I think there's just so many
[[1224.52]]different kinds of CEOs out there if you
[[1229.72]]look like over the long run 50y year
[[1234.68]]period or something the the CEOs who
[[1237.84]]have the best returns in the stock
[[1241.44]]market have been really good at resource
[[1245.84]]allocation meaning meaning they they
[[1251.44]]really understand when their stock is uh
[[1256.76]]overvalued are undervalued and if it's
[[1260.4]]undervalued they buy their own stock if
[[1263.84]]it's overvalued they issue stock and buy
[[1267.0]]other companies and they have they're
[[1271.84]]very in tune with how to buy and sell in
[[1277.0]]the public markets other companies doing
[[1281.2]]m&a or being very smart and that's a
[[1285.56]]that's a that's a pure form of resource
[[1289.44]]allocation within a public company and a
[[1292.4]]private company that's way less
[[1295.12]]important I think uh in private company
[[1298.44]]it's much more yeah I guess you can say
[[1302.52]]resource allocation across teams and
[[1306.48]]okay do I want to put head count into
[[1309.72]]this or that I don't think that's the
[[1312.6]]most important thing in private
[[1315.04]]companies though it's usually like do
[[1317.72]]you have a great vision can you attract
[[1321.8]]the best talent uh and can you just like
[[1326.96]]execute can you actually deliver results
[[1331.0]]against your vision I don't I don't know
[[1334.32]]if that's really resource allocations so
[[1337.4]]it's probably different public versus
[[1340.64]]private I think you learn a lot from
[[1344.28]]wins and losses right when you look at
[[1347.92]]your resource allocation decisions the
[[1351.2]]Investments that you've deliberately
[[1355.16]]chosen to make what have been your best
[[1359.72]]resource allocation decision and what's
[[1363.12]]been your worst and what were the
[[1366.36]]takeaways when you reflect on them I
[[1369.12]]know if it's part of resource
[[1371.84]]allocations we we've raised uh we've
[[1375.32]]raised Capital twice for we did very
[[1380.0]]large rounds of capital at what felt
[[1385.2]]like the peak of a bull market and
[[1388.88]]wanted to put money in the bank so that
[[1391.96]]we can ride out and have a fortres
[[1395.56]]balance sheet to ride out any storm that
[[1400.08]]comes so we did that the first time uh
[[1404.84]]was in 2019 and it turned out the bull
[[1409.52]]market continued uh and you know you
[[1413.4]]can't predict these things but we raised
[[1417.0]]a billion dollars in 2019 and then in
[[1422.32]]2022 we raised $984 million that turned
[[1426.92]]out to be true like that we were kind of
[[1429.72]]at the peak of the bull market and that
[[1433.52]]balance sheet serves us very well today
[[1437.48]]that we have a billion dollars in cash
[[1441.2]]and we're in a place to execute and not
[[1445.72]]be too concerned overly concerned about
[[1449.6]]the the you know there's a recession and
[[1452.76]]Freight right now and capital markets
[[1456.04]]for tech companies have come down quite
[[1459.48]]a bit since then and we have a fortress
[[1462.88]]balance sheet to protect us and insulate
[[1466.16]]us from those problems but you call that
[[1469.44]]resource allocation I sort of do because
[[1472.76]]you're now in a place to protect the
[[1476.08]]company and have cash that you can
[[1480.08]]continue to allocate through the cycle
[[1484.12]]we've done a limited amount of m&a we
[[1488.72]]apply we acquire shopy Logistics um I'm
[[1493.0]]very very proud of that deal I think
[[1496.64]]it's incredibly powerful to now be able
[[1501.28]]to go end to end all the way from
[[1505.52]]Factory to Consumer stores and we
[[1509.12]]deliver into retail stores like do
[[1512.92]]distribution to other Amazon other
[[1517.84]]marketplaces like Amazon FBA or Walmart
[[1522.32]]fulfillment service but also Costco
[[1526.28]]Target Macy's Nordstrom we can we can
[[1530.6]]deliver to retail stores now and so
[[1534.0]]being able to really go all the way end
[[1536.6]]to end we're the only platform in the
[[1539.6]]world that does that seamlessly in one
[[1542.72]]tech place it's a little too early to
[[1545.56]]say if that's like great resource
[[1548.4]]allocation or not I think it I think
[[1551.0]]we'll look back in a few years and say
[[1554.08]]that was incredible before we discuss
[[1557.84]]the the flip side can I ask a blank
[[1561.44]]question you feel the weight of the
[[1565.6]]valuations raised at obviously it was a
[[1570.36]]bull market and prices were high do you
[[1575.44]]feel the waste of L round price I no I
[[1581.52]]don't I think um because the reason is
[[1586.24]]i' I've told my team after every round
[[1590.04]]that we done this is not our evaluation
[[1595.0]]this is a moment in time a group of
[[1600.52]]people with a view of the future and you
[[1605.04]]know because the value of any company at
[[1608.32]]any time is the well it's the net
[[1611.8]]present value of the future cash flows
[[1615.96]]discounted by some you know risk rate of
[[1619.72]]whether or not that's going to come true
[[1622.2]]and what you know what the best
[[1626.0]]opportunity cost is and the future is
[[1630.08]]inherently uncertain we have no idea
[[1632.56]]what the future is going to look like
[[1635.52]]everybody has their own View and so our
[[1638.64]]valuation is sort of like you take all
[[1642.2]]the probable possible Futures out there
[[1646.56]]you assign a probability outcome each of
[[1650.12]]them and you collapse that distribution
[[1654.04]]curve down and you get a you get a price
[[1658.32]]you know another way to say that is like
[[1661.68]]hey there's when we were worth a when we
[[1665.96]]are valuation was marked at8 billion you
[[1670.52]]could say well we're never worth we I I
[[1673.52]]literally told our team this the next
[[1677.0]]day we're not worth $8 billion there's a
[[1680.88]]some probability chance that we're worth
[[1684.32]]we're going to be worth 800 billion and
[[1687.88]]some chance we're going to be worth 80
[[1691.36]]and some chance we'll be worth nothing I
[[1695.88]]mean and our job is as here as employees
[[1700.6]]is not to sit here and think about our
[[1704.2]]valuation and hope that it goes up it's
[[1708.36]]to go make it more certain that those
[[1713.2]]probabilities that we want come true and
[[1717.16]]so you know it doesn't matter what the
[[1720.72]]current price is of the stock like we
[[1725.44]]just got to go execute and make the more
[[1730.36]]the the outcome we like more which is
[[1734.56]]being worth 800 billion someday I mean
[[1738.48]]we're a platform for Global Logistics
[[1743.88]]like global trade is 47% of GDP that's a
[[1748.84]]big number you know if you can be the
[[1751.64]]platform for that you can be worth
[[1754.92]]trillions of dollars so like who cares
[[1758.12]]what our valuation is right now
[[1762.04]]according to some Outsider who doesn't
[[1766.4]]even own flexport stock and writing an
[[1769.96]]analyst opinion on it like that is not
[[1773.56]]how we're going to run this business
[[1776.56]]when you when you put on the Ambassador
[[1779.76]]hat you're like big time
[[1785.6]]tick um on the flip side what was the
[[1791.6]]worst resource allocation decision what
[[1795.4]]was a mistake that you allocated
[[1798.56]]resources to that you shouldn't and how
[[1802.24]]did that change your perspective oh you
[[1807.52]]know like Flex SP is over over the last
[[1812.72]]decade Capital raising came easy to
[[1817.16]]flexport I mean had zero interest rate
[[1821.68]]flexport's a really good bet we get we
[[1825.56]]raise a lot of money I think that that
[[1829.8]]money in I've never seen a company and
[[1833.84]]I've tried this and I've raised as much
[[1837.56]]money as almost anybody I've never seen
[[1841.56]]a company successfully raise a bunch of
[[1845.72]]money and not start spending it in ways
[[1849.36]]that don't that aren't actually very
[[1852.4]]smart it's the biggest risk to raising
[[1855.76]]too much money is you just like lose
[[1859.08]]discipline and you start spending money
[[1863.44]]this was true um by the way from day one
[[1868.92]]we raised a $20 million series a the
[[1874.0]]time it seemed like a ton of money the
[[1878.72]]next day or like within a week we had a
[[1883.04]]conference coming up like a where we
[[1886.56]]were exhibiting at a trade show or
[[1890.8]]something and I immediately purchased a
[[1895.12]]shipping container and transformed it
[[1899.52]]into a booth and spent like 50,000 bucks
[[1903.68]]on this thing and like I don't know if
[[1906.48]]that was a good or bad decision but like
[[1909.36]]I definitely wouldn't have made it two
[[1912.6]]weeks prior when we didn't have the 20
[[1915.52]]million bucks in the bank it's like the
[[1918.76]]money wants to spend itself and so
[[1922.28]]that's the ultimate risk and you can sit
[[1925.0]]here and go we're not going to spend it
[[1927.2]]we're going to pretend we didn't raise
[[1930.0]]it but you would be as a Founder the
[[1934.76]]first person ever to to succeed in that
[[1939.92]]um now I think my advice would be to a
[[1943.24]]Founder who's raising a lot of money and
[[1945.68]]my advice to my former self would be
[[1948.2]]like if you raise a lot of money you
[[1951.64]]should immediately the next day do a
[[1955.64]]hiring freeze and don't hire anybody for
[[1959.2]]90 days and go look money's not going to
[[1963.0]]solve our problems we're going to solve
[[1967.04]]our problems and so over hiring in
[[1970.64]]general has been our biggest mistake and
[[1973.68]]and then we've had to let people go
[[1976.28]]we've done layoffs and it's it's
[[1979.4]]terrible for the culture and so yeah
[[1982.36]]that's definitely the worst Capital
[[1985.24]]allocation is over hiring and we hire
[[1988.24]]great people too by the way it's just
[[1991.12]]like we couldn't afford we didn't have
[[1994.64]]the cost discipline in place and a lot
[[1997.48]]of that's because we raised money too
[[2000.36]]easily I always say like actually get a
[[2003.52]]separate bank account put it in a
[[2006.44]]separate bank account forget that you
[[2009.8]]have that bank account and I have this
[[2014.8]]fight with Parker Conrad always online I
[[2021.56]]tweet it and he just like goes for me I
[[2027.08]]love Parker so I'm saying that lovingly
[[2030.56]]but he's like too much money never
[[2034.6]]killed a company it's a VC ISM you know
[[2039.24]]the more money great and I'm like no it
[[2043.92]]encourages ill discipline and you
[[2048.44]]imprudent spending well look I I
[[2052.84]]actually agree with Parker but I can
[[2057.52]]play both sides of I can be Nuance
[[2061.2]]because I do think I do think look I
[[2063.96]]raised a lot of money I think that was a
[[2066.6]]success I said it was the best example
[[2069.24]]of capital alligation I did was raise a
[[2072.4]]lot of money at the peak however it does
[[2077.0]]lead to bad habits uh and and both these
[[2081.88]]things can be true at the same time uh
[[2085.84]]and and it you know imposing that
[[2089.72]]discipline is totally possible but you
[[2093.92]]have to be living in reality looking p&l
[[2098.2]]every day looking at your team looking
[[2102.44]]at the salaries of your team I think a
[[2106.32]]lot of what I've done that was a mistake
[[2109.48]]was like when you were do performance
[[2112.56]]reviews you can't just do a performance
[[2115.52]]review without also looking at the
[[2119.8]]team's salary uh with the team member
[[2124.4]]salary we let go of a lot of amazing
[[2128.44]]people a few weeks ago we we we let go
[[2132.72]]of about half of our engineering team we
[[2136.28]]now we grew our engineering team this
[[2141.44]]year from 450 software uh team members
[[2147.36]]product and engineering team members to
[[2152.92]]1300 it was super aggressive and then we
[[2157.68]]reigned it back in when I came back as
[[2161.12]]CEO like that that was LED under the
[[2165.16]]prior CEO when I came back in I reigned
[[2169.92]]it in so now we have about 650 people
[[2173.92]]which is more than we've ever had so
[[2177.48]]again that was a mistake we over hired
[[2180.92]]but we let go of a lot of great people
[[2183.64]]including some people I would love to
[[2187.32]]keep on the team but at the salary
[[2191.0]]levels that they were making and that's
[[2194.2]]our fault we overpaid people but we had
[[2197.84]]to let we had to let good people go I
[[2201.2]]feel terrible about it yeah yeah you
[[2204.2]]feel the weight of responsibility when
[[2206.68]]you over High cuz it's one of those
[[2209.36]]tough ones where like it's on you as the
[[2213.08]]employer yeah oh of course and that's me
[[2216.92]]even though I was not the CEO I was the
[[2219.96]]chairman of the board I approved the
[[2224.32]]hiring plans um and so yeah we screwed
[[2229.76]]up on that I think we have a lot of cash
[[2233.52]]you know we have a billion dollars in
[[2237.92]]cash we have um a product road map that
[[2242.84]]we think can really transform the way
[[2247.48]]global trade is done in Global Logistics
[[2252.52]]and we were in a hurry to execute
[[2257.0]]against that road map and we wanted to
[[2261.76]]go build it all and we weren't living
[[2266.2]]enough in reality of like okay it's fine
[[2269.4]]we're the leaders in technology and
[[2272.92]]Freight foring by far like if you look
[[2276.36]]at the freight forwarding companies in
[[2279.6]]the world flx sp's now the third largest
[[2284.48]]of the American companies and top 10
[[2289.8]]globally and if you look at the top 100
[[2293.92]]providers of Global Freight forwarding
[[2297.72]]Services Customs Brokerage and Freight
[[2303.28]]forwarding we the only one founded after
[[2309.04]]the web browser was invented in '94 like
[[2312.76]]we compete against companies that were
[[2315.48]]literally founded in the
[[2319.48]]1800s when you think about it that they
[[2323.84]]know how to somewhere in that building
[[2327.36]]they knew how to ship Freight using
[[2330.96]]Morse code because the telephone hadn't
[[2334.56]]even been invented less the internet I'm
[[2337.64]]not worried that we won't be the leader
[[2340.92]]in technology and it's okay if it takes
[[2344.76]]us a couple more years to build out
[[2347.92]]everything on the road map and I think
[[2350.8]]that was a mistake we were like trying
[[2354.36]]to deliver everything in one year and we
[[2357.6]]don't need to have that pressure it's
[[2360.56]]like hey just sequence things build the
[[2364.04]]quality do it right and and we'll get
[[2367.36]]there well there's another common Trope
[[2370.44]]which is like speed is the single
[[2373.64]]biggest determinant of success in
[[2377.4]]startups and Company building do you
[[2381.4]]believe that's true or given what you
[[2385.6]]just said is speed actually not as
[[2389.96]]important as people maybe suggest oh
[[2393.52]]well I think uh you have to be very
[[2396.36]]careful with your definitions here
[[2399.16]]because I don't think speed is the most
[[2402.72]]important thing I think it's velocity
[[2406.64]]and if you remember your physics
[[2411.44]]velocity has a vector it's speed in the
[[2415.68]]right direction if you're going the
[[2419.44]]wrong direction you're this is terrible
[[2423.84]]and so sometimes the highest velocity
[[2427.36]]thing you can do is stop and do and go
[[2431.44]]nowhere because if you're if your Vel if
[[2435.28]]your speed in the wrong direction that's
[[2438.84]]negative velocity and that's really bad
[[2443.44]]um and so that's the key is being agile
[[2447.2]]being able to change direction because
[[2450.4]]the world's chaotic the world's going to
[[2454.24]]especially in logistics we've seen crazy
[[2459.32]]Stu Co and uh you've had bankruptcies of
[[2463.84]]shipping carriers and then you had them
[[2466.64]]make hundreds of billions of dollars
[[2470.52]]five years later you've had terrorists
[[2475.04]]uh we're seeing everything and so you
[[2478.84]]have to be very Nimble as the world
[[2482.56]]changes to be able to change direction
[[2487.36]]without losing speed that's a very hard
[[2492.0]]thing to do so do you know when you're
[[2496.36]]going in the wrong direction do you know
[[2502.32]]early is it apparent not always um I
[[2507.44]]think that's that's like that's the art
[[2510.88]]of leadership I suppose you know I
[[2514.32]]really like bezos's concept here of like
[[2518.24]]the one-way door and the two-way door
[[2522.56]]and being being able to move very very
[[2526.12]]fast as long as it's easy to change
[[2529.64]]direction and come back that often
[[2532.88]]that's the case and you should go really
[[2535.84]]really fast because it's F sometimes
[[2539.24]]it's a one-way door you can't come back
[[2542.36]]and so then you better be real careful
[[2545.08]]not it's okay to go the wrong direction
[[2548.6]]as long as you can change course and be
[[2553.64]]nimble right but if it's a one-way door
[[2558.28]]type uh type one decision then you got
[[2561.96]]it that those are decisions that need to
[[2565.92]]be made by seeing your people with a lot
[[2570.72]]of judgment to avoid mistakes uh
[[2575.2]]otherwise it's fine to go fast and make
[[2578.88]]mistakes like the only thing I think
[[2583.08]]with that is like so so few things are
[[2587.92]]oneway door like we were talking before
[[2591.88]]we were talking beforehand about you
[[2595.08]]know children and egg freezing which
[[2598.96]]will get taken out of this edited note
[[2604.84]]to take out otherwise I'm but like kids
[[2612.16]]are a oneway door but like so few is
[[2619.8]]actually a oneway door key highes not um
[[2627.68]]strategics in countries not products
[[2636.24]]not is really oneway doors well uh a one
[[2642.24]]spending money you can't get the money
[[2645.0]]back so they can get by Capital
[[2647.88]]alligation making sure you don't blow
[[2651.0]]the money so things that cost a lot of
[[2655.08]]money that's a one way door although we
[[2660.68]]found in logistics that uh it's I think
[[2665.84]]General Batton said it's it's not not
[[2669.2]]how high you climb it's how high you
[[2672.92]]bounce after you fall and so a lot of
[[2676.68]]our best customer relationships are
[[2679.8]]people that we royally screwed up with
[[2682.88]]five years ago but it's how do you
[[2687.04]]respond in that moment do I does the CEO
[[2692.28]]give them a call and apologize and make
[[2696.48]]things right do you take care of them do
[[2700.08]]you do you pay the extra money you know
[[2703.88]]do that's that's ultimately a value
[[2707.48]]system because your values don't really
[[2710.2]]count unless you're willing to give up
[[2712.96]]money for it otherwise it's just word on
[[2716.44]]the wall if you don't show up and you
[[2719.72]]don't really handle things well that
[[2722.8]]could be a oneway door I mean you can I
[[2726.64]]have people that I don't interact with
[[2730.32]]anymore and I won't do business with
[[2733.36]]because that of the way they behave
[[2736.36]]there's there oneway doors out there but
[[2738.84]]I agree with you in general like most
[[2742.08]]things are two-way doors I'm glad after
[[2746.04]]seven years you forgave me Ryan yeah
[[2749.68]]it's a thrill to be
[[2754.64]]back um now I I want to ask I I spoke to
[[2759.6]]so many of your friends and they all of
[[2763.32]]them literally said I had to ask you
[[2769.36]]about Roman Empire your lessons yeah and
[[2775.64]]like how you think about like Roman
[[2781.16]]Empire and its actual like relationship
[[2788.2]]to culture and cult followings and how
[[2794.24]]it impact Valley culture I'm to be
[[2798.12]]honest I'm more of a fan of the uh the
[[2801.28]]ancient Greeks and the ancient Egyptians
[[2804.8]]than the Romans but uh but I do like
[[2809.04]]ancient history how does ancient history
[[2812.96]]then impact your thinking on company
[[2816.12]]building uh I don't know if it does I
[[2819.04]]think it's more of a hobby to be honest
[[2822.8]]I really enjoy uh the work of one author
[[2827.12]]in particular his name is Will Durant
[[2831.56]]will and arel Durant actually wife team
[[2835.72]]um although Will wrote the first five
[[2838.64]]books there's 11 books in the series
[[2841.68]]they're like about thousand pages each
[[2844.4]]and it's the whole history of
[[2847.2]]civilization so I basically read those
[[2850.8]]books I read I read like one of his
[[2853.76]]books and then someone else every year
[[2856.28]]and I alternate back and forth so I've
[[2858.68]]read I've read the whole series like
[[2861.08]]four or five times so that's probably
[[2863.92]]why people think that I'm ask me about
[[2867.84]]Rome I was probably on a Rome kick
[[2871.84]]during some conversation but I'm not I'm
[[2875.72]]not exclusive on Rome by any means and
[[2880.16]]um the reason I like him is that what he
[[2884.48]]does is it's been synthesis it's a type
[[2889.6]]of History where you study all all
[[2895.68]]aspects not just military or political
[[2902.32]]but art culture uh science religion
[[2908.8]]manners morals fashion everything that
[[2914.56]]we know about about a civilization as an
[[2920.8]]interconnected web uh and and it's I
[[2925.32]]think it's actually a really interesting
[[2929.0]]way to think about uh companies because
[[2933.4]]we are very cross fun if you're only
[[2937.68]]focused on product or engineering or
[[2942.2]]sales or one aspect of a company you're
[[2946.0]]really going to miss the collected hole
[[2949.44]]of how these things that are connect I
[[2953.0]]think that that that's a very in so it's
[[2956.08]]not so much about the history it's about
[[2958.76]]the way of writing history that I find
[[2962.36]]really relevant for companies is that if
[[2966.92]]you can when you write your for example
[[2971.48]]your uh annual plans of what is a team
[[2974.84]]going to build sometimes you have to
[[2977.28]]duplicate you have to write the same
[[2980.44]]thing twice but I want to see what is
[[2983.96]]the finance team doing and what is the
[[2987.16]]sales teams doing and do these actually
[[2991.64]]Interlink and is the tech team building
[[2995.96]]the right product to support both of
[[2999.0]]those things and vice versa right are
[[3001.92]]they selling the product that the tech
[[3005.2]]team's building it it takes extra work
[[3008.32]]to go through and make sure all this
[[3011.8]]stuff in links but it's quite contrary
[[3016.8]]by the way to an Amazon mindset which I
[[3021.16]]also respect don't get me wrong but in
[[3024.2]]the Amazon world you sort of like have a
[[3027.2]]business unit that just goes hard and
[[3030.04]]doesn't have to pay attention to all the
[[3033.88]]other business units and I actually far
[[3038.0]]prefer the the cross functional
[[3041.36]]collaboration and teams coming together
[[3045.24]]and reading each other's plans uh and
[[3048.68]]making the plans really transparent to
[[3051.92]]as many people as possible you if you
[[3055.56]]don't have that synthesis then how are
[[3058.8]]you going to know that you're especially
[[3061.32]]in our business where it's an end to-
[[3064.52]]end Logistics offering it's very
[[3068.2]]difficult to do that in a world where
[[3071.68]]people are just thinking about one leg
[[3075.8]]of a shipment or one Department in a
[[3079.48]]company what have been the biggest
[[3082.52]]lessons for you in where those
[[3086.52]]interlinkages break where the cross
[[3091.12]]functions don't work well I I can't
[[3094.96]]speak to every every kind of company
[[3098.0]]there's so many unique businesses out
[[3101.12]]there but but it is you know in our
[[3104.8]]business it's an end to end offering so
[[3108.52]]what the way that FX for works is
[[3112.04]]companies come onto our platform they
[[3115.32]]Place orders to their factories their
[[3119.12]]flexport buy purchase orders buying
[[3123.32]]goods those factories become users the
[[3127.64]]average importer of goods is onboarding
[[3132.0]]18 factories and then those factories
[[3136.6]]become users they Place bookings they
[[3141.28]]say okay the car goes ready on this date
[[3145.2]]uh we send a truck out there and across
[[3149.08]]100 over 100 countries send a truck pick
[[3153.08]]it up export clear it out of that
[[3156.64]]country put it on a ship so we've got to
[[3159.56]]have contracts all the ocean carriers
[[3162.72]]and Airlines across the world clear it
[[3167.32]]your Customs truck picks it up at the
[[3172.44]]airport or the port either direct
[[3176.92]]delivers it directly to the customer
[[3180.96]]puts it on a sometimes we put it on a
[[3184.24]]train actually and skip the truck
[[3186.88]]sometimes we do a barge in Europe up a
[[3189.96]]lot of barge shipping in China too and
[[3194.24]]go up the Ryan River uh sometimes we'll
[[3198.32]]bring it to a warehouse unload the
[[3202.32]]container put it on a dry van on a
[[3206.72]]regular truck deliver it bring it to
[[3211.36]]another Warehouse we then deconsolidate
[[3215.64]]it and ship it to customer stores or
[[3219.08]]into retail stores so it's an incredible
[[3222.48]]amount of complexity as you can imagine
[[3225.4]]I haven't even mentioned there's a bank
[[3228.52]]that's financing that transaction where
[[3232.96]]it's Flex work capital uh there's a
[[3237.32]]someone doing the payments you know the
[[3240.64]]wire transfer there's an insurance
[[3244.64]]company doing cargo Insurance uh and
[[3248.88]]then there's returns there it's a it's a
[[3252.64]]very complex Network so if you try to
[[3258.48]]run this where all each leg is just only
[[3264.44]]thinking about themselves in isolation
[[3269.0]]you're very likely to screw something up
[[3275.44]]uh because a mistake a change in China
[[3282.6]]at the origin or in Vietnam and a delay
[[3287.84]]there I've got to replan everything
[[3291.56]]Downstream because you know the trucks
[[3295.0]]not going to be the the truck now has to
[[3299.6]]be rescheduled a week later uh three
[[3304.12]]weeks later silos are incredibly
[[3308.12]]dangerous in logistics and yet there's
[[3313.16]]no possible or chart that could solve
[[3318.0]]this people work in simpler businesses
[[3322.08]]they want they they they try to solve
[[3326.44]]these problems with an org design that
[[3330.68]]says okay everybody you know these
[[3335.56]]people report to me but the only person
[[3340.8]]only this one person can have everybody
[[3344.6]]in that Network that I describe
[[3347.76]]reporting to them and then they become a
[[3351.44]]bottleneck now the Amazon's done a good
[[3355.4]]job with the API memo beos is trying to
[[3359.04]]solve this with it everybody should
[[3362.04]]communicate with apis and we don't want
[[3364.76]]to have any meetings that's correct we
[[3367.76]]developing that direction but in the
[[3370.44]]meantime before you have everything
[[3373.68]]being API of everything of your team
[[3377.68]]talking to everybody by apis you just
[[3381.12]]have to sit down and collaborate you
[[3384.24]]have to read each other's plans you have
[[3387.6]]to line up make sure that you know the
[[3391.64]]handoffs are seamless that each team
[[3395.16]]because the way we're organized is each
[[3398.56]]of those legs as a team but they got to
[[3402.08]]pay attention to what's upstream and
[[3405.64]]downstream of them Ryan how many direct
[[3410.68]]reports do you have uh right now I have
[[3416.16]]15 is that not too many uh for our
[[3420.44]]business it's the best way I've had I've
[[3424.96]]had as few as six uh it turned out much
[[3430.36]]better to have more and I get more
[[3434.32]]collaboration but I don't want have a 15
[[3437.16]]person meeting unless I just need to
[[3439.88]]tell everybody something we don't make
[[3442.92]]decisions with all 15 people in the room
[[3446.44]]it's not like we sit down and you know
[[3449.76]]because if you did everybody would I
[[3452.4]]think I did the math on this and
[[3454.72]]everyone talk for five minutes or
[[3457.2]]something four minutes that's not a very
[[3459.92]]useful meeting if everybody talked
[[3462.44]]equally which obviously they wouldn't
[[3466.2]]but um no so we what we do instead is we
[[3471.88]]grab uh four five six people for
[[3476.92]]whatever the topic is that we need and
[[3480.4]]we'll go deep and not just those six
[[3484.24]]people who report to me but some usually
[[3488.56]]uh layer down from the technology or
[[3491.88]]someone from the front lines who
[[3494.52]]understands the issue and that's where
[[3497.52]]we you know we make decisions in in
[[3500.84]]small groups like that not not with all
[[3504.36]]15 people speaking of making those
[[3508.16]]decisions in small groups culture is so
[[3511.8]]important for it that people feel able
[[3515.2]]to talk to you that they're not scared
[[3519.76]]to that they can discuss the hardest
[[3525.4]]things I've been bad actually at culture
[[3530.08]]building being young I kind of always
[[3533.68]]thought friendship was the way to build
[[3536.92]]companies which is the worst thing ever
[[3540.12]]what have been your biggest mistakes on
[[3544.04]]culture um yeah I think trying to be
[[3548.96]]popular is a big mistake um you have to
[[3553.16]]do what's right not what's popular in
[[3556.12]]the company and sometimes you do things
[[3559.2]]that are unpopular but if it's the right
[[3562.4]]thing to do you got to do it the goal of
[[3565.84]]a culture is to drive velocity we're
[[3569.04]]talking about velocity before speed in
[[3571.24]]the right direction you gota have a
[[3573.68]]great mission to do that you gota have a
[[3577.56]]great mission of purpose why are we here
[[3581.28]]uh you know FX Sports mission is to make
[[3584.2]]Global Commerce so easy there will be
[[3587.96]]more of it like I think that's inspiring
[[3592.04]]like let's increase GDP for the world
[[3596.24]]let's help people create opportunity and
[[3600.6]]get richer help our customers solve
[[3604.56]]problems like this is inspiring it's fun
[[3608.48]]um we get to learn a lot too like
[[3612.04]]Logistics is you're kind of a backstage
[[3615.12]]PA of the world economy what's happening
[[3617.84]]in all the world's companies how are
[[3621.2]]they run help them with their problems
[[3625.2]]so having a sense of purpose so you
[[3628.12]]actually know we're all rooll in the
[[3631.28]]same direction absolutely crucial for a
[[3635.16]]good culture it's like sounds cliche but
[[3638.88]]you can't do enough of it two is you got
[[3642.88]]to have trust which means people doing
[[3647.92]]what they say not talking crap behind
[[3652.68]]each other's back putting the issues on
[[3655.96]]the table a culture where you're not
[[3660.8]]going to get scorched because you where
[[3666.08]]you criticize somebody for example one
[[3669.92]]thing I do for this is that we have an
[[3674.08]]open channel in our slack instance where
[[3678.32]]anybody can ask the leadership team a
[[3682.56]]question and I mean I praise people who
[[3687.76]]ask hard questions who criticize us I
[[3692.8]]mean I think that's also I prefer I like
[[3697.32]]courageous people uh and I think that
[[3701.76]]builds Tres what's been the hardest
[[3705.64]]question oh we got we get questions a
[[3709.56]]lot of questions about um you know we
[[3713.68]]laid people people off so you obviously
[[3716.88]]going to get a lot of tough questions
[[3719.44]]when you do something like that around
[[3723.12]]benefits and salaries and you think of
[[3727.72]]this thing or we really reduce the size
[[3731.76]]of this team does that mean you don't
[[3735.0]]value this team things like that are
[[3738.16]]tough questions though but I respect
[[3742.8]]that courage imagine being small small
[[3748.92]]as Rob Junior person in a company not
[[3753.84]]have not been around very long and
[[3758.88]]challenging This Global CEO publicly in
[[3763.92]]front of everybody that's awesome like
[[3767.52]]that's courageous so much better there's
[[3771.16]]this Anonymous social network it's like
[[3774.96]]the terrible all the cowards go there
[[3778.24]]and just talk trash like you're
[[3781.0]]obviously a coward if you're allowed to
[[3784.4]]talk in public and ask the open question
[[3788.16]]but you're too cowardly to do it you
[[3792.2]]post on the anonymous social networks I
[[3796.28]]think that builds trust I think having
[[3799.36]]things like that where you can just
[[3802.32]]answer questions I'm not afraid of any
[[3805.56]]question I don't always have the best
[[3808.96]]answer well I'm not afraid of it I live
[[3812.92]]in public and be authentic uh the only
[[3817.04]]way I know how to do it so a sense of
[[3822.12]]purpose the sense of trust um I think um
[[3827.36]]using intuition is really important for
[[3832.24]]culture like it can't be all data data
[[3837.44]]data is overrated in my opinion data is
[[3842.92]]valuable but data's too slow and often
[[3848.92]]it's inaccurate and most humans are not
[[3853.56]]actually using data the way they pretend
[[3858.2]]to use data most people know what they
[[3862.72]]want to do and then they use data to
[[3865.44]]justify what they were going to do
[[3868.4]]anyways uh and you can always find some
[[3872.0]]data to back up your case if you're
[[3875.72]]certain I respect that I think people
[[3879.48]]who have good judgment can make
[[3883.2]]decisions move fast data is also very
[[3886.28]]slow you know it takes a long time to
[[3889.4]]get the data you want and you often need
[[3893.8]]to move faster than that and data has
[[3899.08]]one major drawback which is that all
[[3904.12]]data comes from the same place which is
[[3908.6]]the past and like if the future looks
[[3912.16]]different from the past your data is
[[3915.16]]completely useless people who use
[[3918.4]]intuition you got to blend data I'm not
[[3921.44]]saying data is bad like a big part of
[[3924.6]]what we do is provide better data about
[[3928.36]]Supply chains but you got to have eye
[[3932.28]]judgment people interpreting data saying
[[3936.04]]is this actually right I mean the number
[[3939.44]]of times I've been shown some data and
[[3942.32]]then be like but what about this and
[[3946.52]]like I you know instantly I can debug
[[3952.08]]reports on data so so using intuition is
[[3957.16]]key um a culture of learning is really
[[3963.04]]key like honoring mistakes not not not
[[3968.32]]scorching people who make a mistake and
[[3971.44]]constantly trying to learn and get
[[3974.76]]better these are like all really
[[3978.92]]important aspects to building a high
[[3983.04]]velocity culture where people can you
[[3987.24]]know build trust and go fast and execute
[[3992.08]]on on that mission a lot of what you
[[3996.04]]just said is predicated on actually
[[3999.48]]having the right people on board as well
[[4003.32]]you know they have to want to learn they
[[4007.68]]have to bluntly be honest and genuine
[[4012.52]]people again have made many hiring
[[4016.8]]mistakes what are some of the biggest
[[4020.56]]hiring lessons you have that you wish
[[4024.32]]You' known when you started or in the
[[4029.84]]earlier years don't hire outside people
[[4035.28]]I rather much don't hire senior
[[4039.96]]Executives I think in almost all I'm not
[[4044.76]]looked at of blanker rule we've hired a
[[4048.2]]lot of great senior Executives at
[[4051.04]]flexport over the years and and a lot of
[[4054.16]]them are doing amazing work for us but
[[4058.2]]it's so much higher risk than promoting
[[4063.6]]from within um and and so much better
[[4068.64]]you get to know people you get to really
[[4072.4]]get bought in that they believe deeply
[[4076.0]]in your mission they built credibility
[[4079.72]]and respect and stretch people and
[[4083.36]]promote people from within I think that
[[4086.16]]I didn't do enough with that over the
[[4090.24]]years I think uh trying to pursue in
[[4095.48]]blind pursuit of growth and and and
[[4099.88]]hitting our goals and being Global and
[[4104.76]]taking over the world and bringing our
[[4110.64]]vision to life you need help and you
[[4116.0]]turn externally instead of going hey I'm
[[4119.32]]I've actually got amazing people at
[[4122.44]]flexb like we have X Flex War people who
[[4127.44]]are in key roles like way more senior at
[[4132.52]]amazing comp companes than than they
[[4136.56]]were doing at flexport and we didn't
[[4140.32]]promote them and they left them do
[[4144.12]]better things somewhere else and like so
[[4148.64]]I I I think uh spending more time with
[[4153.04]]your customers and more time in the
[[4157.24]]presence of your people and more time
[[4161.88]]with the front lines so you can identif
[[4166.04]]like the key job of leadership is
[[4171.04]]identifying Talent within your company
[[4175.88]]certainly yes but like it's so much
[[4179.36]]better if you can get internal folks and
[[4182.76]]promote them the problem is like
[[4185.68]]companies are in a hurry you know and we
[[4188.48]]want to achieve things really fast and
[[4191.52]]it's kind of a shortcut to go higher
[[4195.16]]Senor people from outside how do you
[[4199.96]]know when a stretch is a stretch too far
[[4205.24]]oh you got to try it I mean you know I
[[4209.56]]don't know it's a tragedy it is a
[[4214.04]]tragedy because when that happens that
[[4218.64]]people tend to lead the company instead
[[4222.4]]and I think agree culture should be able
[[4225.48]]to go hey you know what like if you
[[4229.08]]could really do this the right way we
[[4232.76]]haven't figured this out but I would
[[4236.84]]love to is like hey we shum didn't work
[[4242.04]]out let's bring them back to a role that
[[4247.04]]that matters but Egos and compensation
[[4252.08]]and other factors being what they are it
[[4255.8]]tends to be when you stretch people too
[[4258.4]]far they lead the company and that and
[[4261.68]]that stinks because uh we've lost a lot
[[4265.04]]of great talent and if I just think
[[4267.92]]about all the great people have left
[[4271.24]]flexport over the years if they were
[[4274.64]]still here we'd be like 10 times better
[[4278.12]]company if you're out there come back
[[4281.44]]we'd love to have you my honest
[[4284.84]]reflection on people management is like
[[4289.2]]being CEO is the worst thing ever
[[4293.4]]because great people you permanently wor
[[4297.52]]will be leaving because they're so good
[[4301.36]]average people you permanently worry
[[4305.0]]that they're not good enough and bad
[[4308.44]]people you permanently worry that you
[[4311.88]]should have got rid of them last week do
[[4316.32]]you agree with that I think it's a it's
[[4320.8]]an incredible job being the CEO of a
[[4324.12]]company if you believe in the mission
[[4326.64]]and you love what you're doing you know
[[4329.2]]and you're executing against the vision
[[4333.56]]it's an incredible job uh but it's not a
[[4338.6]]easy job and it's not necessarily flaw I
[[4342.4]]mean it's people look from the outside
[[4345.92]]and think like I'll be an entrepreneur
[[4349.92]]I'll be the CEO and like it's it's
[[4355.2]]really tough man I mean it is not an
[[4360.36]]easy thing to do for for the reasons
[[4364.72]]that you said and and many others but he
[[4368.96]]that's that's why you know that's why we
[[4372.96]]do it because we want we believe deeply
[[4376.84]]in what we're trying to achieve and I I
[[4379.92]]I don't know I'm kind of unemployable I
[[4382.12]]don't want to work for somebody else I
[[4385.52]]want to go build stuff your brother told
[[4390.72]]me you unemployable uh no your your your
[[4395.24]]wife though asked the question you said
[[4399.4]]there about kind of the The Mirage of
[[4403.84]]Entrepreneurship your wife said what's
[[4408.52]]the biggest misconception people have of
[[4415.36]]flax sport today versus what it is
[[4422.08]]really uh well there's been a lot of you
[[4425.88]]know black sports has been in the news a
[[4430.16]]while lately um we had CEO trend I the
[[4435.68]]demand for Scandal and drama is way
[[4440.84]]higher than the supply in this world and
[[4444.8]]the media has been really
[[4447.88]]sensationalizing some stuff there was a
[[4452.28]]story about flexport that I will not
[[4456.0]]Point people to because I don't want to
[[4458.4]]give it any attention because it was
[[4462.16]]other crap but it was a whole article
[[4466.8]]flport delivered 33 million packages to
[[4470.56]]Consumers homes on that's what we're on
[[4474.6]]track to do this year then one package
[[4479.4]]got lost and they wrote this all this
[[4483.36]]mainstream media publication wrote an
[[4486.68]]entire story where the first four
[[4490.4]]paragraphs are about a lady who pack I
[[4494.24]]feel bad for her I'm sorry like we lost
[[4498.32]]the package we genuinely we screwed that
[[4502.88]]up we reimburse her in full but like one
[[4507.24]]out of 33 million I mean that is like
[[4510.6]]you know this is people trying to
[[4514.6]]sensationalize and stir up drama or like
[[4519.04]]that same article clean that one of our
[[4523.08]]biggest customers was really unhappy
[[4527.6]]with us literally the customer went on
[[4532.0]]the record telling them that's not true
[[4536.76]]we were very happy with flexp and they
[[4542.2]]didn't publish that they they wrote two
[[4546.36]]they wrote that we have sources saying
[[4549.64]]that they're not happy but like the for
[[4553.24]]out the company told you that that's not
[[4557.44]]true so the media wants to drive these
[[4562.48]]narratives about Blackport as if we're a
[[4566.4]]mess or something when in fact if you
[[4569.36]]come hang out with us or you're one of
[[4573.08]]our customers you know like we are high
[[4577.44]]energy our culture is stronger than it's
[[4581.92]]ever been we're really well Finance we
[[4586.12]]have almost a billion dollars in cash
[[4590.2]]we're going to be profitable next year
[[4593.68]]but like if you read an article about
[[4596.72]]flexware today it would be like oh this
[[4600.52]]company's in a difficult position or
[[4604.56]]something so I don't know I part why I
[[4607.88]]want to come on podcast and like tell
[[4611.4]]the story directly because the media
[[4614.92]]once you and you know I've talk to these
[[4617.48]]people and told my story and then they
[[4620.36]]just don't publish any of that they
[[4624.8]]publish sensationalist stuff so you said
[[4629.96]]it earlier you said you can use data for
[[4635.48]]whatever your end is and so if there's
[[4640.24]]any data that suggests it's not in line
[[4643.84]]with your story well that didn't get
[[4647.96]]that data exactly exactly exactly and by
[[4651.24]]way the media is pretty good to fight
[[4653.76]]over years I'm not like I'm not a huge
[[4656.6]]critic of the media but in the current
[[4660.04]]moment people are liking to tell the
[[4663.72]]sensation that's what drives clicks or
[[4666.6]]whatever metric they're looking for but
[[4668.88]]over the years the media has been good
[[4671.92]]do I'm like been part of our success is
[[4675.52]]get the story out and attract customers
[[4678.68]]and talent so I think we'll get back
[[4682.08]]there we just got to go do a good job I
[[4686.24]]I totally get you and agree it does seem
[[4690.4]]like a harsh piece speaking of kind of
[[4694.96]]like in the media the world is a more
[[4699.56]]nerve-wracking place than ever in many
[[4703.4]]ways I spoke to Brian singerman before
[[4706.8]]this and he said there's nothing he
[[4709.52]]loves more than talking to you about
[[4712.96]]bluntly the state of the world and how
[[4718.44]]you see kind of macro geopolitics today
[[4723.68]]and I'd love to ask when you think about
[[4727.96]]kind of geopolitical macro how do you
[[4732.72]]think the future for trade with China
[[4736.92]]well China is a very unique
[[4740.48]]manufacturing capability that you can't
[[4744.4]]replace easily you know people will love
[[4748.76]]to say the the United States government
[[4752.12]]is doing their best with imposing
[[4755.4]]tariffs on on Imports uh coming from
[[4760.0]]China companies with simple products
[[4765.48]]like think apparel Etc are moving out
[[4770.12]]away from China want to avoid the duty
[[4773.68]]but Chinese uh the Chinese economy's
[[4777.28]]done so well that their labor prices
[[4780.96]]have gone way out you know the average
[[4784.76]]hourly wage in Mexico is now cheaper
[[4788.32]]than in China so if you're just looking
[[4791.56]]for cheap labor and that's great for
[[4794.28]]China right like good for them like
[[4797.16]]they're making more money as you know
[[4800.32]]their population so China is no longer
[[4803.12]]the cheapest manufacturing side in the
[[4806.16]]world but it's the best manufacturing
[[4810.0]]like they're the highest quality highest
[[4813.88]]competency in manufacturing so if you're
[[4817.0]]doing Electronics you're doing anything
[[4820.56]]sophisticated or not anything but a lot
[[4823.96]]of the really sophisticated forms of
[[4826.6]]manufacturing China's the best place to
[[4830.2]]buy things um so I don't think that's
[[4833.92]]going to go away I think people will
[[4837.44]]always be shifting away from higher
[[4842.36]]labor cost to cheaper labor costs and
[[4846.6]]tariffs they're going to do what they
[[4849.8]]can to optimize against
[[4853.68]]tariffs I think in general there's
[[4857.0]]Global it's we're in an interesting
[[4859.96]]moment right now where globalization is
[[4863.92]]in question like whether or not we're
[[4868.48]]going to continue to do trade globally
[[4872.0]]or will we just produce everything
[[4874.84]]domestically or there going to be more
[[4878.96]]boundaries more nationalism uh more
[[4883.48]]maybe regional trade and that's that's
[[4886.64]]we're at a moment in time where that
[[4890.28]]looks like a big interesting debate but
[[4894.12]]I would point to the long you know
[[4898.16]]talking about history that global trade
[[4903.36]]has grown 4% annually uh since the
[[4909.28]]Mongol invasions in around 1200
[[4913.96]]I mean it looks you know 4% doesn't
[[4916.92]]sound like much but when you put 4% on
[[4920.96]]an 800e curve it's a phenomenal hockey
[[4925.8]]stick like Silicon Valley's never seen
[[4929.52]]uh and I would predict that that'll
[[4932.76]]continue because it's innate in the
[[4937.4]]human species with specialization and
[[4942.2]]trade is like one of the main things
[[4945.72]]that separates us from the Animal
[[4948.8]]Kingdom Adam Smith wrote this I've never
[[4952.76]]seen a dog trade a bone with another dog
[[4957.68]]we see animals exhibiting all kinds of
[[4962.28]]other behaviors language and Tool use
[[4965.68]]and other stuff but trade is not
[[4968.96]]something that they do and trade is
[[4972.44]]fundamentally with the building block of
[[4975.8]]civilization because it allows
[[4979.44]]specialization it allows gains it allows
[[4983.48]]wealth creation so humans want to trade
[[4987.08]]with each other now governments will try
[[4990.64]]to stop things there will be special
[[4995.08]]interest that may want to block trade
[[4999.24]]but left to their own devices humans
[[5003.6]]will trade more and more and more uh and
[[5007.48]]so I I would predict that that's what's
[[5010.76]]going to happen because we always find a
[[5014.04]]way they will trade more and more and
[[5016.64]]more I'm just really intrigued do you
[[5019.96]]think that will be globalized trade or
[[5023.88]]nationalized trade I think it'll be
[[5027.92]]globalized trade I think uh first of all
[[5032.08]]the the ship is an incredibly efficient
[[5035.6]]way of moving things around the world
[[5038.92]]far more efficient than any other you
[[5043.28]]know landbased transport in fact though
[[5048.08]]you know I I I I've had this blog post
[[5052.24]]that I want to write about how Fiji
[[5055.64]]Water is the most environmentally
[[5058.68]]friendly water it gets criticized all
[[5063.32]]the time you because ocean Freight is so
[[5068.04]]carbon neutral that by getting it and
[[5071.88]]shipping it from Fiji to the west coast
[[5075.6]]of the United States emits way less
[[5078.72]]carbon than running a truck from the
[[5082.0]]Rocky Mountains to the West Coast you
[[5085.24]]know there there's a lot of reasons and
[[5089.28]]ocean parate is cheap it's Rel
[[5093.44]]the fact that you can ship a TV across
[[5096.8]]the world for a few dollars is just a
[[5101.0]]remarkable feat of engineering and human
[[5105.68]]Ingenuity now war is a big risk I have
[[5110.4]]no no way to understand the risk of of
[[5116.88]]of war and and what that can do to trade
[[5123.36]]civilization and therefore trade depends
[[5128.12]]on peace we take it for granted we've
[[5132.0]]lived in this great period of Peace for
[[5136.04]]most of our lives at least in the United
[[5140.0]]States in the Western World the wars
[[5143.36]]that have exist have been largely
[[5147.4]]removed from us and the daily impact
[[5151.4]]that but if that changes yeah of course
[[5155.12]]trade is at risk and so we take there's
[[5159.2]]a lot of black swans that can happen but
[[5162.88]]even Wars that you know World War II
[[5165.92]]seemed like the most catastrophic thing
[[5169.12]]that could ever happen and if you look
[[5173.84]]at the graph of GDP or trade you barely
[[5179.56]]notice the blip or if you look at a long
[[5184.48]]R to what extent is planning even
[[5189.12]]valuable in your business when you have
[[5194.16]]coid when you have Ukraine when you have
[[5199.92]]you Global place that just throw the
[[5206.76]]world into chaos I think it was e said
[[5212.68]]planning is invaluable the plan the
[[5216.64]]plans are useless but the exercise of
[[5220.56]]doing planning is incredibly valuable to
[[5224.24]]think strategically to take a moment
[[5227.2]]back and step back and think about what
[[5230.84]]you're doing and why you're doing it um
[[5234.64]]that's a very valuable exercise where
[[5237.56]]you have to be very adaptable when the
[[5240.68]]world changes and probably that's a a
[[5243.88]]strength and a weakness of mine I'm very
[[5247.0]]good at changing direction probably
[[5250.76]]change direction too easily also and so
[[5254.64]]having some firm view of where you're
[[5259.16]]going is really important can I weird
[[5264.04]]one before we just discuss parenting
[[5267.32]]which I do have to discuss because I
[[5270.28]]think it's fascinating helpful for me
[[5274.4]]question would you belong China China
[[5278.36]]have so many problems from you know
[[5282.88]]population decline manufacturing decline
[[5288.08]]reversion away from urbanization would
[[5292.56]]you be long China or short yeah know
[[5296.36]]it's hard for me to do macro type stuff
[[5300.12]]like that I think that Chinese China has
[[5304.32]]a few advantages that we take that we
[[5308.36]]don't have Chinese China believes in
[[5312.44]]China Chinese people believe in China
[[5316.48]]half of Americans hate hate America I
[[5319.8]]think that's a huge advantage to have as
[[5322.92]]a civilization to believe that what
[[5326.24]]you're doing is that you're part of
[[5329.72]]something that's bigger than yourself
[[5333.64]]and try to support your country you know
[[5338.16]]we lack that these days in America um
[[5342.04]]and that's a huge advantage to have
[[5345.56]]they're incredibly industrious people
[[5348.92]]they're working they are hungry they
[[5352.92]]want success they work six days a week I
[[5356.68]]a lot of people don't realize I Liv in
[[5359.32]]China for two years they work satour
[[5362.36]]days we don't work SST you know that's a
[[5365.32]]bit extreme but most Chinese people work
[[5368.52]]six days a week what how much more
[[5371.36]]productive would you be work at extra
[[5374.12]]20% you know they're industrious they're
[[5376.96]]hardw working they're intelligent they
[[5379.28]]have a lot going for them their
[[5382.24]]leadership is incredibly smart they have
[[5385.56]]some demographic challenges that are
[[5388.92]]beyond my scope to understand because
[[5391.68]]you know people are like the
[[5394.44]]population's declining not China is not
[[5397.68]]the worst in this by any means there's
[[5400.72]]uh there's Western countries Italy and
[[5404.44]]Korea uh other countries that are
[[5409.2]]declining faster but I always think like
[[5413.56]]well but isn't it better if you have to
[[5416.92]]your people to share the resources I
[[5419.52]]don't know I don't know how to think
[[5421.32]]about that they still have way more
[[5424.36]]people than we do in the United States
[[5428.08]]I'm not like a macro investor by any
[[5431.32]]means I always I I did study a lot of
[[5434.68]]Economics I always found macroeconomics
[[5437.92]]to be impossible I think people who
[[5440.68]]pretend they understand it are probably
[[5443.64]]wrong I don't make big you know
[[5447.0]]civilization level predictions like that
[[5450.56]]but I I lived in China for a few years I
[[5454.84]]have immense respect for Chinese culture
[[5459.96]]Chinese people Chinese food uh there's
[[5464.32]]there's a lot to love about China two
[[5467.68]]interest rates hit double digits do you
[[5471.56]]think some people suggest we're just at
[[5475.44]]the start some people suggest they won't
[[5479.92]]go higher we'll see easing why do you
[[5484.44]]say oh I'm not I'm not the right guy to
[[5487.88]]ask about interest rates I don't know
[[5491.16]]man it's like if they do the United
[[5493.88]]States government's GNA be a lot of
[[5496.72]]trouble we can't pay our debt of 10%
[[5499.8]]interest they have to keep printing
[[5503.28]]money and then you have an inflationary
[[5507.2]]cycle which then makes interest rates go
[[5511.6]]even higher so seems pretty ugly okay
[[5515.56]]before we move into a quick fight I'm
[[5518.24]]going to ask something that you do have
[[5521.28]]direct experience and you will be able
[[5526.12]]to lend some wisdom parenting okay you
[[5532.6]]are a CEO of a you know a thousand plus
[[5537.32]]how how many people work at flight sport
[[5541.12]]now 2500
[[5547.4]]2500 can you tell me how do you still be
[[5554.48]]a great father and be CEO of a 2500
[[5559.8]]person company what do you know now that
[[5563.8]]you wish you'd known when you had kids
[[5568.64]]well love is you know when most value so
[[5573.32]]I love my children so much that I want
[[5576.8]]to get home and make sure I get time to

[[5583.36]]hang out with them every night and see

[[5590.28]]three-year-old and a one-year-old U my
[[5593.64]]especially my older daughter my

[[5606.48]]little bow of energy so I love playing
[[5610.84]]with her and I make time for that and um
[[5614.48]]yeah then I work more in the evenings
[[5617.96]]after she goes to bed and I get up early
[[5622.76]]and work and that's fine I mean I think
[[5627.04]]I can work I work as hard now as I ever
[[5630.6]]worked in my life and I just have to
[[5634.96]]deprioritize some other stuff did having
[[5639.24]]kids change you it's yeah it's like a
[[5643.0]]chemical wash that flows over your whole
[[5646.92]]body and filling you with love and
[[5650.56]]respect for the universe and like
[[5653.8]]understanding also a great way to
[[5656.92]]understand your own parents your
[[5660.12]]relationship with them like remember
[[5663.76]]like all the stuff that they went
[[5667.12]]through that I'd never even thought

[[5700.56]]lot of like thinking back on my

[[5748.52]]the greatest wife in the world my wife

[[5757.2]]life H she's been incredible advisor for
[[5761.68]]me on all things and by the way I was
[[5765.0]]criticizing the media before but my
[[5768.24]]wife's a former reporter so I'm like
[[5771.76]]well in tune with how the media works
[[5776.16]]and uh she's a great like communications
[[5780.68]]director helping them you know
[[5784.4]]understand how to behave how to get the
[[5788.44]]media like well I was Billy flexo well
[[5792.92]]before I met her and she's always known
[[5797.72]]that flexo's my baby and that you know
[[5802.32]]serious priority for me and that I'm
[[5807.24]]very fortunate to find a woman who want
[[5811.6]]like knew that and signed up for it and
[[5815.08]]wants to help me in every way and I I
[[5818.88]]don't know I never take it for granted
[[5823.2]]does she have a
[[5825.76]]sister a wonderful sister married with
[[5831.12]]married with kids that bit gets taken
[[5835.24]]out too
[[5839.12]]guys uh final one Ryme before we do a
[[5844.08]]quick fire you're a very secure dude
[[5848.4]]you're just very kind of content and
[[5851.92]]happy in yourself when I speak to you
[[5855.92]]which is quite rare considering the the
[[5860.56]]CEOs that I speak to interesting what's
[[5864.8]]your biggest insecurity in leadership sh
[[5868.72]]today no I did feel very secure you know
[[5873.6]]part of it is um I uh I mentioned I
[[5879.04]]lived in China for a few years I was
[[5885.64]]super broke making no money and I was
[[5891.48]]living really well it was like the best
[[5895.56]]couple years of my life at that time in
[[5899.84]]a real sense of adventure and fun this
[[5905.72]]was H 17 years 17 or 18 years ago and uh
[[5911.84]]I realized I don't need a lot to succeed
[[5915.88]]and be happy like I was like I made
[[5919.52]]$177,000 one year and it was like one of
[[5922.72]]the best years of my life and I was
[[5925.64]]trying to make money by the way like oh
[[5928.28]]I don't even I was like trying to make
[[5931.16]]money and and I didn't make a lot of
[[5934.36]]money but I was very happy and I ate
[[5937.76]]well and I had friends and that's given
[[5942.08]]me a lot of C you know uh there's a lot
[[5946.0]]of me to take risk in my career and I've
[[5949.72]]started multiple successful companies
[[5954.52]]not just wxport but import genius
[[5959.88]]room.com I started a lot of businesses
[[5965.08]]invested in you know over 100 companies
[[5969.84]]and done really well as an investor so I
[[5973.8]]I I like no matter what happens I'll be
[[5977.6]]fine because I can be poor and happy
[[5981.72]]it's not about making money and so it's
[[5985.2]]like gives me a sense of security that
[[5988.28]]I'll be fine my wife my wife's not going
[[5991.84]]to leave me if we if we lose money we'll
[[5995.76]]do it together it'll be fine like so
[[6000.36]]does money make you happy well money can
[[6004.56]]money can solve problems and problems
[[6007.72]]can make you unhappy so yeah know money
[[6011.0]]can definitely contribute to happiness
[[6014.36]]if it can get if it can make problems go
[[6017.48]]away there's definitely a the place
[[6021.24]]where you know you money it's very funny
[[6025.08]]because humans are
[[6029.04]]mimetic now we copy each other we want
[[6033.36]]more and so you have to be very careful
[[6037.04]]of Who Your Role Models are and who you
[[6040.84]]imitate and be careful not to hang out
[[6044.16]]with people who have way more money than
[[6047.2]]you because you'll you'll aspire to do
[[6051.04]]things that you can't afford uh spend
[[6054.6]]money on stuff that won't actually make
[[6058.04]]you happy uh and so picking your role
[[6061.52]]models I think is one of the most and
[[6064.76]]and just your friends who you hang out
[[6068.36]]with one of the most important things uh
[[6073.36]]in life and yeah so make you know money
[[6078.04]]alone definitely is if that's all you're
[[6081.8]]after definitely a recipe for misery
[[6086.0]]that's that sounds cliche but it's true
[[6090.56]]but but but if if you know what you want
[[6094.6]]in life money will definitely help you
[[6098.08]]get there faster help you solve problems
[[6102.12]]and overcome obstacles and things like
[[6105.72]]this you mentioned your success
[[6109.52]]investing I spoke to Chad before and he
[[6113.92]]said literally right before and he asked
[[6118.32]]why do you love investing in Rebels or
[[6123.68]]people with Messy pass where something's
[[6129.2]]gone wrong in previous companies why do
[[6133.4]]you love that revenge is a really
[[6136.56]]powerful
[[6140.84]]motivator H in life you you want people
[[6145.6]]are motivated and driven and if someone
[[6149.08]]feels like they've been wronged there's
[[6151.96]]a couple benefits one they're going to
[[6155.92]]be incredibly driven to go solve that
[[6161.0]]you know to go have a comeback story two
[[6164.32]]is they're probably going to get pass
[[6166.52]]over by other
[[6169.6]]investors and that's that's what you
[[6173.8]]need like you need a contrarian opinion
[[6177.48]]and you have to be sure that they did
[[6180.92]]they were not like they didn't have a
[[6185.44]]moral ethical failing or if they did it
[[6189.2]]was something that minor that can be
[[6192.36]]forgiven you know it didn't really hurt
[[6196.4]]other people maybe they broke some rule
[[6200.6]]or something but like didn't there were
[[6204.44]]there weren't innocent people were not
[[6208.56]]harmed and then in that case if you can
[[6211.92]]get really comfortable with that and
[[6215.24]]they're really talented and other people
[[6219.24]]aren't willing to invest in them then
[[6222.56]]that's like a perfect storm for for
[[6225.6]]finding a great ch
[[6228.56]]and to Parker
[[6232.68]]Conrad I've got I've got I've got a list
[[6236.92]]of people that I've back that match that
[[6240.56]]profile and and Parker's one of them
[[6244.44]]yeah I think Parker was wrongly
[[6247.96]]scapegoated and run out of town at
[[6251.48]]benefits then he and he proved it by
[[6255.52]]going to build ripling into a business
[[6259.16]]that's much bigger and better than ref
[[6263.0]]renit ever was in the exact same space
[[6267.92]]I'm sure that the investors who did that
[[6273.4]]regret it and and uh and that's fine
[[6279.44]]Parker's a you know Parker's not that uh
[[6284.2]]doesn't care per se he just wants to go
[[6288.16]]execute has Angel Investing changed how
[[6293.48]]you are as a CEO yeah I probably it
[[6298.48]]helped me a lot to understand the the VC
[[6302.28]]world how it works probably help me with
[[6305.52]]some of our fundraising having a little
[[6308.12]]bit of perspective being on the other
[[6310.56]]side of the table understanding the game
[[6314.2]]more being being having you make friends
[[6318.2]]with other investors and can learn more
[[6322.64]]about the the VC world and how to how to
[[6327.56]]navigate it but I think net net no I
[[6331.2]]don't know if it has because it's also
[[6335.2]]taking up time I don't spend a lot of I
[[6339.16]]haven't spent a lot of time on it but
[[6341.88]]you know it's inevitably going to take
[[6345.12]]up some time I do it not not because
[[6349.88]]it's going to help me i s qu Angel
[[6354.28]]wesing a while ago basically I'll do it
[[6357.2]]a little bit here there if it's a friend
[[6359.96]]of mine or something but the reality is
[[6363.24]]any time spent away from flexport is
[[6367.24]]probably net negative for flexport I
[[6371.0]]mean I spent all my time on flexport if
[[6374.16]]I want to make flexport more successful
[[6378.68]]yeah life is not all about money or one
[[6383.84]]thing like I enjoy it I like learning I
[[6387.8]]like making friends with other Founders
[[6391.52]]I benefit from those relationships in
[[6395.16]]ways that are hard to predict and and
[[6398.76]]certainly 10 years ago 12 years ago when
[[6402.52]]I started Angel invest I I don't know
[[6405.92]]who knew what what I was doing I'm just
[[6409.6]]trying to get out here and have fun who
[[6415.04]]knows what VCS are doing not
[[6418.44]]them I'm just kidding we have thesis um
[[6424.04]]I'm going to do a quick firearm with you
[[6428.2]]so I want to start uh with a question
[[6432.48]]what concerns you most in the world
[[6435.6]]today when you look at the landscape
[[6441.4]]what concerns you War violence mob
[[6449.08]]violence uh the scapegoating of innocent
[[6455.4]]people and civilians being caught up in
[[6461.04]]the consequences yeah violence has
[[6467.56]]managing teams got harder with the rise
[[6475.28]]of woke Society managing teams is always
[[6482.28]]hard dealing with people who are not
[[6487.44]]focused on the company's Mission and
[[6490.64]]have their own missions that are
[[6494.2]]separate from a company's mission is
[[6498.88]]incredibly frustrating because there's a
[[6503.04]]million organizations in this world one
[[6507.84]]for every possible topic that you want
[[6513.48]]to drive and so finding people at
[[6517.76]]flexport who are focused on anything
[[6522.28]]other than Flex board successful at work
[[6527.32]]is like really really frustrating I
[[6530.8]]don't care what you want to focus on
[[6533.92]]outside of work at all what your
[[6537.8]]politics are what your cause is I think
[[6541.12]]that's awesome people should have
[[6543.76]]passion to do stuff but like that's not
[[6546.92]]what flexport's all about at the company
[[6549.92]]during the day like let's just talk
[[6552.8]]about our problems are hard enough we
[[6556.4]]got to make Global Commerce easy we got
[[6560.2]]to ship Cargo in every corner of the
[[6563.64]]world like this is hard enough we don't
[[6567.32]]we can't solve other people's challenges
[[6572.36]]outside of that remote work versus work
[[6577.64]]in office what are your thoughts there I
[[6584.0]]think remot work is very very difficult
[[6590.64]]to achieve a build a company culture I
[[6595.36]]think individuals can succeed I'm
[[6600.64]]incredibly productive working in my
[[6605.72]]house with there's no distraction I'm
[[6609.64]]incredibly productive individual
[[6613.52]]contributor but great things get
[[6617.84]]achieved by teams and teams don't really
[[6622.64]]form over video conferencing teams form
[[6626.72]]when you get together and you
[[6630.2]]collaborate and you have dialogue and
[[6634.92]]like you capture emotion body language
[[6640.52]]and contact and you jam and you stay up
[[6645.04]]late and it's not constrained by the 30
[[6649.36]]minutes of our video call like and that
[[6653.88]]just doesn't happen on remote work I'm
[[6658.04]]always one of your cool things learning
[[6661.92]]and when you and me do a presentation
[[6665.0]]together and we leave and get a coffee
[[6668.12]]afterwards I say dude I didn't like the
[[6671.52]]way that you presented that and I think
[[6674.8]]we could have done it differently in
[[6678.76]]this way that's a good idea you don't
[[6683.4]]have that spont of it man like I'm
[[6689.64]]walking around last we do and flexb is
[[6694.96]]struggling to get team members to come
[[6697.84]]back to work right now and I it wasn't
[[6700.96]]up you know it wasn't our Focus the last
[[6704.24]]few months but it's absolutely my focus
[[6708.04]]right now I'm I'm pretty frustrated by
[[6711.24]]people at flexb who don't want to come
[[6714.08]]into our offices I've just let them go
[[6717.4]]though we're we're starting to do that
[[6720.36]]and treat it as Performance Management
[[6723.04]]but we we're setting some new policies
[[6725.64]]around this in the in the coming weeks
[[6728.44]]but um it is a performance management
[[6731.08]]issue no there certain people for
[[6733.56]]exceptions and people who are
[[6736.72]]outstanding track records of performing
[[6740.24]]at home and in individual contributor
[[6743.8]]jobs but if you you want to be part of
[[6746.96]]if you want to I've told this team over
[[6749.6]]and over again if if you want to succeed
[[6752.8]]at flexp to get ahead you should come to
[[6756.4]]the office but even just last week I you
[[6759.56]]know I do a weekly town
[[6762.88]]at whatever office I'm in and just take
[[6767.44]]question I share what's on my mind uh
[[6771.4]]and then and then take questions from
[[6775.12]]the team um and after this town hall I
[[6779.44]]just hang out I had a guy come up to me
[[6783.36]]last week and just tell me hey you know
[[6787.2]]we have this opportunity to like get $2
[[6791.28]]million extra profit if we just do these
[[6795.56]]three things differently and I was like
[[6798.72]]who would you told about this he's like
[[6802.12]]nobody I'm like you know if we weren't
[[6806.56]]in the office together like would lose
[[6811.0]]$2 million right here let's go you know
[[6815.04]]and and and there's countless things
[[6818.36]]like this I'm just like getting people
[[6821.36]]in the office so that information can
[[6825.48]]flow freely and solve problems by the
[[6831.04]]way I think remote work can really work
[[6836.28]]but it's not going to benefit the people
[[6840.56]]who think like it's not going to be
[[6843.56]]people making
[[6846.92]]$250,000 a year hanging out in Jackson
[[6851.68]]Hole it's going to be Geniuses in the
[[6857.2]]developing world making you know who all
[[6861.6]]of a sudden there's an Arbitrage you can
[[6865.56]]find incredibly smart people all over
[[6870.4]]the planet and pay them one 100th or
[[6874.96]]111th whatever GDP is I mean look at the
[[6878.88]]GDP in the Philippines or something and
[[6882.44]]there's tons of geniuses over there and
[[6886.16]]so you could build a great company of
[[6890.32]]remote work but it's not going to be the
[[6894.4]]people who are advocating for remote
[[6897.24]]work inside these companies in the
[[6900.52]]United States like if I'm if I'm remote
[[6904.48]]why am I going to pay someone 250k in
[[6908.36]]San Francisco to be remote I I'll go
[[6912.68]]find someone in a cheap location so I I
[[6915.96]]don't think the people who are
[[6918.48]]advocating the strongest for remote work
[[6921.12]]actually know what they're advocating
[[6924.0]]for because if they're going to end up
[[6928.04]]in a world without a job because someone
[[6932.2]]they're now competing globally with
[[6935.92]]Geniuses all over the developing World
[[6939.32]]well if you change your mind on in the
[[6942.92]]last 12 months so one for me is like I
[[6947.0]]used to think firsttime Founders the
[[6952.52]]naivity the excitement was so important
[[6957.8]]actually [ __ ] that firsttime Founders
[[6961.92]]make so many stupid mistakes yes there
[[6965.72]]are the one in the millions and you have
[[6969.4]]to always be open to them but generally
[[6974.96]]speaking your net 80% good quality is
[[6980.36]]from serial entrepreneurs you know I had
[[6984.52]]this idea of this um go after these
[[6988.04]]business units that could work in
[[6991.48]]isolation and run really fast I think
[[6994.68]]that works for a lot of companies but as
[[6996.96]]I was describing that doesn't work in
[[7000.16]]fport we have to be an end to end we
[[7004.56]]have to deal with a little bit more
[[7009.24]]process uh process is probably the the
[[7013.68]]only the closest we have to a good word
[[7017.96]]for bureaucracy and there's a there's a
[[7021.84]]healthy amount of that that like
[[7025.68]]actually a lot of the true bureaucracy
[[7030.36]]in companies comes from um a lack of
[[7034.92]]process where people can't get anything
[[7038.36]]done and they don't know how it works
[[7041.2]]but putting in a little bit of process
[[7044.92]]and putting in more of an endtoend view
[[7049.44]]making people write the same thing twice
[[7053.6]]in two different teams planning
[[7057.64]]documents making people spend a little
[[7061.28]]bit more time in a meeting to understand
[[7065.8]]another team's objectives uh and not and
[[7070.2]]not have this Envision that like oh we
[[7072.88]]can just run really fast and ignore
[[7076.48]]everybody around us um that just doesn't
[[7081.56]]really work in our industry no I I I I
[[7086.48]]agree totally uh penultimate one
[[7091.48]]favorite warlord general or Emperor and
[[7098.24]]why definitely Napoleon the reason why
[[7104.12]]he's a very interesting mind first of
[[7109.08]]all uh you know won like 38 battles or
[[7114.2]]something 38 and one I forget his record
[[7119.4]]he's pretty pretty great General Rose
[[7124.84]]through the ranks came up through the
[[7129.36]]you know from the Grass Grass Roots came
[[7134.76]]up uh and Incredibly well read as well
[[7139.88]]like you know the egyptology is
[[7143.32]]basically created because Napoleon
[[7147.6]]wanted to invade Egypt uh to to cut off
[[7153.4]]the British Empire's access to India and
[[7157.6]]while he was there he brought all these
[[7160.32]]scientists and like you know that's
[[7164.56]]where we got the Rosetta Stone and the
[[7169.56]]understanding the decoupling the Hier GS
[[7173.04]]and then he wrote the law code the
[[7176.16]]Napoleonic Code which is basically the
[[7180.04]]law of the land and half of Europe today
[[7184.04]]all the way till now reorganize
[[7188.2]]everything yeah Napoleon is incredible
[[7191.48]]um there's a great book called the mind
[[7193.44]]of
[[7196.24]]Napoleon which is out of print it's like
[[7201.24]]$200 on eBay uh and it's just bull of
[[7206.4]]all it is is his quotes and he has a
[[7210.12]]quote on every subject it halfs of them
[[7213.36]]will Appo you in the modern world but I
[[7217.2]]find those to be the most fun and Al of
[[7220.44]]them are just like man this guy's an
[[7223.36]]actual genius but yet it has a nice
[[7226.6]]index in the back so you can look up any
[[7229.76]]subject and see what Napoleon thought
[[7233.88]]final one for you Ryan it's 2023 now
[[7239.92]]soon to be 2024 where are you in 2033
[[7245.44]]you still see a flexport and where's
[[7248.88]]flexport then definitely still see a
[[7252.28]]flexport and hopefully hopefully you
[[7256.4]]know the rest of my life uh can can stay
[[7261.08]]in the seat and health willing I love
[[7265.36]]this job I never I never wanted to leave
[[7268.56]]the job I just thought Dave would do a
[[7272.44]]better job than me uh and so I'm thr to
[[7277.32]]be back and you know executing 233 it's
[[7281.12]]man it's hard to predict with what's
[[7284.56]]happening with AI and everything else in
[[7288.2]]the world you know I don't I don't
[[7291.28]]really believe in predicting that far
[[7294.24]]out but one thing i' definitely want to
[[7298.2]]still be the CEO of flexb and do believe
[[7302.48]]global trade is here to stay and I think
[[7305.6]]actually what we're seeing is that Flex
[[7309.28]]is incredibly well positioned from an AI
[[7314.56]]to use AI to to implement it because
[[7319.52]]we've structured all the data at global
[[7323.72]]trade and have we're basically an
[[7327.52]]incumbent we're the third largest
[[7330.48]]provider of international forwarding
[[7333.6]]services in the United States so we have
[[7337.8]]incumbent level data but we have the
[[7342.4]]technology sack and the team that can
[[7346.52]]actually go and and Implement well one
[[7350.0]]of the things we've done is break a a
[[7353.48]]shipment when you ship a container from
[[7356.64]]door to door we've broke it in into
[[7361.32]]these discre tasks like a work item uh
[[7366.24]]that that get completed and we're
[[7369.24]]finding out that once you chunk it down
[[7372.92]]into something that simple that AI can
[[7378.04]]complete the tasks uh and so we're like
[[7382.6]]almost every couple weeks we're
[[7387.08]]implementing something that used to take
[[7391.84]]hours or days and take getting it down
[[7395.44]]to minutes I think we'll actually see
[[7398.76]]that AI we're going to be a huge
[[7403.16]]beneficiary of that labor in the
[[7409.48]]forwarding layer of global trade is 10%
[[7414.28]]of the cost of shipping things
[[7417.08]]internationally not the labor of the
[[7420.68]]people people driving the the cars the
[[7424.92]]trucks and the the ships and the planes
[[7429.36]]but the labor of the coordination layer
[[7433.48]]of ending off the documents I I often
[[7436.88]]joke it should be instead of freight
[[7439.88]]forwarding it should be Freight email
[[7443.8]]forwarding and so labor in that
[[7448.76]]forwarding layer is 10% of the cost of
[[7454.04]]shipping things and we're seeing that AI
[[7459.64]]can just do tons of these tasks and it
[[7463.72]]doesn't mean that you'll have less
[[7467.04]]people working at flexport by the way
[[7470.4]]because if you're really successful in
[[7472.92]]automating things you're going to need
[[7475.72]]more people you're going to have more
[[7478.72]]salesp people more Engineers you're
[[7481.88]]going to take over the world and and
[[7485.08]]employ even more people and that's a
[[7488.16]]real fallacy I mean that would be like
[[7492.0]]arguing that uh the invention of the
[[7496.52]]plow is going to eliminate jobs and we
[[7500.92]]should all just still be using you know
[[7505.76]]sticks to to dig holes to put seeds in
[[7510.84]]there grow our own food like that's an
[[7514.76]]argument as old as time and it's silly
[[7518.44]]like AI is going to create way more jobs
[[7522.56]]than it destroys but if you make
[[7526.76]]everything 10% cheaper we can have a
[[7530.64]]world of abundance so I think we're
[[7534.0]]that's that's where I like to see us in
[[7539.0]]2033 Ron loved doing this thank you for
[[7544.4]]my wide ranging conversation from
[[7548.8]]parenting to the future of trade and
[[7553.4]]China in between you are a start and
[[7557.92]]I've loved doing this my my my pleasure
[[7562.08]]Harry thanks for having me on and uh
[[7566.96]]talk to you soon
