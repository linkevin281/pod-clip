[[0]]welcome to the Logan Bartlett show I am
[[3.42]]your host Logan Bartlett and what you're
[[5.88]]going to hear on this episode is a
[[8.58]]conversation I have with Emmett sheer
[[12.12]]Emmett is the co-founder and former CEO
[[16.2]]of twitch one of the most influential
[[20.58]]Tech Platforms in recent memory from its
[[24.66]]humble beginnings as a reality
[[28.68]]television show focused on one of his
[[33.36]]friends to the most influential online
[[38.04]]community that exists I came with a
[[41.64]]framework for prioritizing features
[[44.28]]which is I got out of talking to a bunch
[[46.92]]of streamers and they wanted to fame
[[50.04]]love and money is this thing producing
[[53.46]]more money more fame or more love right
[[56.76]]we will prioritize resources against
[[60.42]]those is it not then it's not important
[[63.78]]or we're not going to do that Emmett and
[[66.78]]I take the conversation at a bunch of
[[69.84]]different directions about how he
[[73.44]]learned to grow as a leader and how he
[[77.22]]ultimately sold the business to Amazon
[[81.18]]and then stayed on for another 10 years
[[85.38]]after that running the company Amazon
[[89.7]]actually lets CEOs be CEOs if you want
[[93.54]]to sell your company and keep running it
[[96.48]]I couldn't recommend any really any big
[[99.6]]tech company other than Amazon how do we
[[102.78]]just make sure twitch continues to be
[[106.02]]the best place for streamers we also
[[110.22]]talk about why he thinks remote work is
[[114.78]]actually bad for most tech companies
[[118.08]]there's a reason why silicon Valley's
[[120.84]]taking over you can't take that culture
[[123.66]]and Transplant it into a remote work
[[126.72]]environment and expect it to work Emmett
[[130.92]]was a part of the first y combinator
[[136.62]]batch in 2006 along with the founders of
[[142.02]]Reddit and Sam Altman and so we talked
[[145.98]]what it was like in the early days of
[[149.64]]working with Paul Graham at YC he's
[[152.94]]going to walk away from the conversation
[[157.5]]with Paul believing we are the shed we
[[162.18]]are smart capable and we're going to
[[165.12]]take over the world the only thing
[[167.82]]standing between us and taking over the
[[170.46]]world is we have to go grind even harder
[[173.7]]road trips are not tours of gas stations
[[177.0]]and your life shouldn't be a tour of
[[180.72]]money picking finally Emmett shares what
[[184.62]]he's most concerned about with
[[188.4]]artificial intelligence so here's now
[[193.04]]Emma
[[195.52]]thanks for doing this
[[199.84]]um you had four co-founders of twitch
[[205.6]]Justin TV uh you stayed on ran twitch
[[211.3]]Michael has been running various aspects
[[216.46]]of YC over the years uh Kyle started
[[221.56]]Cruise after he left
[[225.88]]and then Justin
[[231.04]]Khan is a quasi internet celebrity at
[[235.84]]this point I mean he's gone through a
[[239.44]]bunch of stuff but yeah he had Atrium he
[[244.0]]had exact Atrium and now yeah now I
[[249.34]]think internet celebrity and uh DJ DJ
[[255.28]]got it interesting guy uh what made your
[[260.74]]relationships to their co-founders such
[[265.24]]that you guys all stayed together and
[[270.82]]worked well together over the years so
[[276.6]]uh I've known Justin since I was eight
[[281.46]]uh we grew up together in Seattle went
[[286.18]]to school together uh school being a
[[291.4]]high school elementary school uh Middle
[[296.14]]School who she didn't go to the same
[[299.26]]high school but then we did go to the
[[302.44]]same College again
[[307.84]]um and I met we met Michael uh in
[[313.0]]college probably closer to Justin than
[[317.38]]to me uh and then Kyle we recruited out
[[322.6]]of MIT uh as we were starting the
[[327.7]]company he was a uh he was a I think a
[[331.72]]sophomore at the time
[[334.84]]how did you come across Kyle well he
[[338.98]]says an email to the MIT like hackers
[[343.66]]who want projects list and two people
[[348.34]]replied and one of them was Kyle
[[352.66]]um and uh
[[356.02]]he thought we seemed incredible because
[[360.16]]we built a startup and sold it on eBay
[[365.02]]before and we thought he seemed credible
[[370.06]]because he sent us a 27-page PDF with
[[376.72]]CAD drawings and so we uh uh we wound up
[[382.06]]we want to pick him up selling a startup
[[385.18]]on eBay by the way we glossed over that
[[389.56]]but uh you literally listed the IP for
[[394.18]]your company on eBay which is an
[[397.6]]interesting separate story you've told
[[400.42]]it you've told him enough I won't make
[[402.82]]it again but I can tell the short
[[405.64]]version of it which is that we'd started
[[409.0]]a copy of Google Calendar but before
[[412.9]]Google Calendar existed and after Google
[[416.62]]launched Google Calendar we were like oh
[[419.26]]we didn't really have any other ideas
[[422.92]]for what to do other than a JavaScript
[[427.12]]calendar on the internet and they
[[431.62]]already did that so uh we decided we'd
[[436.66]]sell it uh
[[440.8]]we didn't know how to sell something on
[[444.16]]the Internet like how to sell us a
[[448.0]]software company uh especially one that
[[452.38]]wasn't like a real acquisition and so we
[[456.16]]thought we just listed on eBay uh which
[[459.28]]which worked actually we sold like a
[[462.22]]quarter million dollars
[[465.64]]um which
[[468.82]]um I think it's actually a good
[[472.24]]demonstration of like the kind of thing
[[476.02]]you have to do in startups a lot which
[[478.9]]is
[[481.9]]you you have to just figure out how to
[[486.52]]solve a problem uh
[[492.04]]even if the standard paths don't that
[[497.32]]you have to make up what what it is
[[501.52]]um there's a lot of making it up uh that
[[504.7]]has to happen first first thing like
[[508.36]]startup because almost by definition the
[[512.38]]normal stuff isn't isn't all set up was
[[516.1]]that a PR did you know it was going to
[[520.12]]be kind of PR stunty and that that would
[[524.44]]lead to distribution yeah that was that
[[527.74]]was the idea that was part of it the
[[529.96]]idea was we were like we need to get
[[532.84]]people to know we're selling it how do
[[536.26]]we reach them oh if we listed on eBay
[[539.56]]that'll be funny we can get people to
[[542.98]]write an article about that it was very
[[546.16]]intentional it actually worked it worked
[[548.86]]that's how it worked it worked it worked
[[551.92]]as planned actually yeah minus the fact
[[555.04]]that eBay took down our listing is we
[[558.64]]had two links in it
[[563.56]]um about five days into the seven day
[[568.24]]listing and we had to relist it which is
[[572.14]]kind of a hard stopping experience
[[575.5]]because we had one bit at fifty thousand
[[578.02]]dollars at that point and we were like
[[581.86]]no we've lost our bidder uh but it turns
[[586.54]]out that uh that that didn't actually
[[589.9]]hurt us at all so you had the
[[593.08]]credibility of that and so Kyle was like
[[596.38]]these guys have credibility yeah they
[[599.86]]they must know what they're doing I I
[[603.22]]think Kyle overestimated how much
[[605.74]]credibility that should have given us
[[609.16]]but uh it did it did prove that we were
[[612.82]]the kind of people who like could
[[616.12]]actually build things um and sell them
[[620.86]]so that's I guess it wasn't a zero and
[[625.54]]there was a deep level of trust but also
[[629.32]]some dysfunction among the group Kyle
[[632.98]]went nocturnal for a while to avoid
[[637.78]]conflicts so yeah there's actually we
[[642.4]]did a podcast about this uh an only
[[646.54]]friends episode which is great it's
[[650.92]]super entertaining two hours of like you
[[654.4]]guys shooting the yeah if you want
[[658.42]]the the full full deep details version
[[666.58]]of it but the high level version is uh
[[676.38]]like it worked because all four of us
[[682.74]]trusted each other
[[686.44]]um and we somehow managed to pick four
[[691.36]]people who were smart hard-working you
[[697.0]]know competent but I think most of all
[[700.84]]who had the
[[704.2]]who understood what it meant to be part
[[709.24]]of a Wii not not a bunch of individuals
[[716.38]]always thinking about whether or not uh
[[721.96]]how is this working for me
[[725.86]]um and I think that that's what makes
[[730.9]]uh that's what makes Partnerships work
[[734.5]]um
[[737.14]]both probably like romantic Partnerships
[[741.82]]and business Partnerships because if
[[745.78]]you're going to be in a a partnership
[[748.48]]not an employer employee relationship
[[752.2]]but a partnership relationship you can't
[[757.48]]always be thinking about whether or not
[[762.82]]or you can't be modeling what what are
[[766.6]]they doing are they are they trying to
[[769.72]]what what's their incentive versus my
[[772.9]]incentive versus the company's incentive
[[776.56]]it's dramatically simplifying it makes
[[780.04]]everything a lot easier if you can just
[[783.52]]only think about what is right for the
[[787.36]]company and then just ignore everything
[[790.24]]else
[[792.7]]um
[[795.04]]and I think that that's something that
[[798.28]]goes wrong in a lot of uh a lot of
[[801.64]]things and it's it's what causes
[[805.06]]instability because suddenly
[[808.78]]when there's lots of interest at stake
[[812.08]]there is conflict about my interest
[[815.62]]versus your interest but when you can
[[819.34]]simplify it to well what is our interest
[[822.34]]and everyone everyone can actually
[[825.46]]commit to that uh it works pretty well
[[829.54]]is there any way to solve for that as
[[833.44]]you're now working more with
[[836.74]]entrepreneurs
[[840.82]]um yeah be that way yourself yeah like
[[845.32]]the number one the number one cause of
[[848.68]]the problem in all of your relationships
[[852.94]]is you that's true again romantically
[[858.76]]and in business uh and
[[866.08]]the solvings for how do I
[[874.54]]actually buy into this is this is we we
[[879.94]]are doing this is really important and
[[883.06]]then also obviously you need to work
[[886.36]]with people who have that mindset as
[[890.32]]well but you have less control over that
[[894.82]]and you have less ability to detect it
[[898.0]]and at some level you know you have to
[[900.52]]trust and Hope
[[904.06]]but uh I think there's something about
[[908.26]]if if you do it
[[911.5]]first of all you can control that so
[[915.4]]that's good but second of all
[[920.02]]it brings it out of other people when
[[923.74]]they when they can see that you're
[[928.12]]serious about we and you're not
[[932.86]]you're not run you're not gaming them
[[937.3]]you're not cheating uh you're not like
[[941.44]]pretending you're about all about we and
[[944.26]]then actually being about yourself
[[947.32]]people respond to that it draws it out
[[951.22]]of your partner as well so you launched
[[954.76]]and shipped a bunch of products over the
[[959.14]]years uh that ultimately led to Twitch
[[964.3]]so there was a calendar for gmail which
[[968.26]]was you and Justin then after that
[[972.1]]social network for families SoundCloud
[[976.78]]like business a web crawler that map
[[981.76]]popularity like clout a flexible to-do
[[986.62]]list kind of an airtable-ish thing an
[[991.0]]Evite competitor something that was kind
[[995.56]]of similar to GitHub her Roku replet
[[999.58]]whatever you want to call it then Justin
[[1003.3]]TV ultimately twitch I heard you say
[[1006.96]]something interesting when learning you
[[1009.9]]get exposure to a wide variety of
[[1012.96]]problems related to the topic to
[[1016.56]]actually teach you how to understand and
[[1020.52]]see the differences between things you
[[1024.06]]don't just study one piece of music to
[[1028.08]]learn music did all these experiments
[[1032.28]]and all the different products that you
[[1036.18]]guys iterated on did it actually help
[[1040.44]]prepare you for twitch's success or are
[[1044.82]]they just aimless Cycles along the way
[[1049.26]]um I think did help prepare us I think
[[1053.16]]the main thing they actually prepared me
[[1057.9]]for was building like I did learn
[[1062.58]]something from the product work on it
[[1066.24]]but honestly we did such a bad job on
[[1069.26]]the product
[[1073.88]]uh design aspects of it and the sort of
[[1079.2]]business design aspects of it that I
[[1082.14]]didn't learn as much from that as I'd
[[1085.32]]like to what I what we learned from is
[[1088.56]]the engineering side of it like the
[[1090.9]]design side of it like how do you
[[1093.96]]actually build a thing that like
[[1099.3]]functions and and has uh has
[[1104.64]]functionality and not too many bugs and
[[1109.56]]I got a ton out of stuff on the uh
[[1115.62]]uh on the building side I would say on
[[1122.52]]the on the how does stuff work side and
[[1128.22]]learning how to design how to how to
[[1131.22]]build a product how to build a
[[1133.98]]successful business
[[1137.52]]um the stuff I built myself was probably
[[1140.94]]only
[[1146.22]]a tenth of the data mostly I was like
[[1152.82]]obsessively studying how other
[[1158.04]]businesses worked because you get a lot
[[1162.36]]more you can only launch a new thing
[[1166.8]]every you know few weeks if you're fast
[[1171.06]]usually every few months like a
[[1174.96]]significant new thing but there's new
[[1178.92]]stuff being launched all the time and if
[[1182.34]]you want the number of reps you need you
[[1186.42]]can't just learn from your own your own
[[1190.14]]mistakes you have to be learning from
[[1192.42]]everyone else's mistakes and everyone
[[1195.48]]else's successes at the same time I
[[1201.42]]think that's the uh that was my
[[1207.9]]you know my primary uh you know
[[1213.0]]University for that was it what was with
[[1218.04]]Justin with Michael with Kyle every
[[1223.02]]lunch every night every weekend like we
[[1228.6]]just talked about startups Non-Stop and
[[1233.04]]the thing we would often be talking
[[1237.18]]about would be not our startup but like
[[1242.76]]oh why is you know Facebook is working
[[1247.08]]why is Facebook working why are they
[[1249.72]]beating Myspace like what's different
[[1252.66]]about it why what's good about their
[[1255.6]]strategy what's not good about their
[[1258.06]]strategy
[[1260.1]]um
[[1262.98]]and that
[[1267.0]]and really carefully paying attention
[[1271.08]]and trying out and like using the
[[1275.4]]product and and
[[1278.88]]paying attention to what is actually
[[1281.88]]working in the real world you learn a
[[1285.54]]lot I think that's where that's probably
[[1289.2]]the main thing I learned from from a
[[1293.22]]design point of view I I I joke that
[[1298.74]]that's my main only value as a career
[[1304.92]]Finance person investor is one I'm used
[[1309.36]]to just giving advice and letting people
[[1312.18]]decide you know I'm not used to having
[[1315.12]]actually owning the decision myself
[[1318.42]]which is actually can be nice as a board
[[1321.78]]member like hey here are the options and
[[1325.38]]two you get to simulate out a lot of
[[1328.98]]different data points for all the
[[1332.22]]companies that come in and pitch and so
[[1336.66]]you're you can extrapolate on a bunch of
[[1340.68]]different stuff there
[[1343.56]]one of the things that uh I have a
[[1348.42]]friend uh Matt who uh almost started our
[[1353.04]]first company with us but instead went
[[1356.4]]into went into finance and you know runs
[[1360.66]]a hedge fund and uh
[[1365.4]]uh has worked at a bunch of the finance
[[1370.62]]jobs over the years uh and he's he's an
[[1374.52]]investor in what I've discovered is
[[1377.34]]investors have this
[[1381.36]]just in totally different lens at least
[[1385.5]]you know public markets investors and I
[[1388.68]]think most private markets investors as
[[1391.92]]well who are a later stage where it's
[[1396.24]]about like whether the industry is good
[[1401.22]]and like the capital allocation like the
[[1405.54]]structure of the business which is not
[[1408.42]]something actually that Founders think
[[1410.64]]about all that much and I think I think
[[1413.22]]it's right that Founders don't think
[[1416.34]]about that because For the First
[[1420.18]]two three years of a company
[[1424.62]]it doesn't matter like just build
[[1428.64]]something people want and sell it to
[[1432.66]]them like ignore everything else but as
[[1436.5]]you get bigger and bigger those things
[[1439.98]]become actually quite important and you
[[1443.82]]start to try to think about oh or in
[[1447.06]]this industry but we could be in this
[[1449.64]]adjacent industry and there's some way
[[1453.06]]to shift how our business is perceived
[[1457.74]]or what kind of work we do and how
[[1461.34]]what's the structure of how Capital
[[1464.1]]flows work and can we change that and
[[1467.46]]those actually do become very important
[[1471.24]]questions but like usually later
[[1474.42]]um there's sort of a handoff that
[[1478.02]]happens it's funny to hear you all talk
[[1483.9]]about like iterating on the product and
[[1489.54]]trying to find something and one of the
[[1493.44]]throwaway lines I've heard I don't know
[[1496.56]]if is you adjusted or someone's saying
[[1499.8]]we could go be build Enterprise software
[[1502.86]]but that's boring and we don't want to
[[1506.28]]go do that I was like you know in 2006
[[1510.18]]or 2007 you would have created a lot of
[[1513.36]]value doing Enterprise software and you
[[1517.74]]were just like hey not for us that's too
[[1523.86]]boring to go pursue it um I think uh we
[[1529.14]]we talked about building instead of
[[1533.4]]twitch or social cam
[[1537.3]]um because Michael went and uh founded
[[1540.18]]social cam which you end up selling to
[[1543.24]]Autodesk that was weird in a way the
[[1546.54]]Autodesk thing never really made sense
[[1548.82]]to me
[[1551.16]]um
[[1554.52]]we talked about building a WebEx
[[1558.3]]competitor because like WebEx is
[[1561.42]]obviously a huge market like
[[1565.32]]teleconferencing and
[[1570.96]]we have like no doubt we could build a
[[1575.7]]better product than WebEx because WebEx
[[1578.82]]is annoying to use
[[1581.52]]which we're basically talking about Zoom
[[1584.34]]right a more consumer version of WebEx
[[1587.28]]is zoom
[[1590.22]]um and
[[1595.26]]we decided against it because we knew it
[[1600.54]]would involve Enterprise no not the
[[1603.9]]product side of it but the sales side of
[[1607.74]]it like Enterprise sales is like a whole
[[1613.26]]business and uh
[[1618.36]]we just like had no interest in like
[[1621.84]]learning how to do that
[[1625.8]]um and it's actually uh
[[1630.48]]I think I think a good example of sort
[[1634.14]]of knowing yourself like I actually
[[1637.92]]don't think I would have had I think I
[[1641.58]]probably could have learned how to do it
[[1643.98]]but I don't think I didn't want to do
[[1646.44]]that I wanted to do something else and I
[[1649.08]]think it's it's important for Founders
[[1651.36]]to do after the thing that they're
[[1653.4]]interested in
[[1656.46]]um although
[[1660.48]]it was also a better time for Consumer
[[1664.26]]like I think
[[1668.04]]uh we go twitch worked a lot of actually
[[1671.58]]good consumers companies started around
[[1675.24]]that time it got a lot harder to win in
[[1680.58]]consumer as the big player is
[[1687.66]]Consolidated uh more of distribution and
[[1693.0]]I think
[[1696.48]]uh I think three or four years later
[[1699.84]]maybe we would have pivoted into
[[1702.96]]Enterprise just because lack of any
[[1706.38]]credible other option just getting
[[1709.68]]distribution would have been really hard
[[1713.28]]with and certainly today it's a huge
[[1717.96]]pain um there's an hourglass quote that
[[1722.4]]I like a lot and I know you do as well I
[[1726.12]]think I've quoted it before uh I won't
[[1730.26]]read the whole thing but nobody tells
[[1733.98]]this to people who are beginners I wish
[[1737.1]]someone told me all of us who do
[[1739.98]]creative work we get into it because we
[[1743.22]]have good taste but there is a gap for
[[1746.22]]the first couple years you bake stuff
[[1748.8]]it's not that good it's trying to be
[[1751.74]]good it has potential but it's not but
[[1754.8]]your taste the thing that got you to the
[[1758.94]]game is still killer and your taste is
[[1763.56]]why your work disappoints you a lot of
[[1766.98]]people never get past this phase they
[[1770.34]]quit most people I know who do interest
[[1774.3]]in Creative work went through years of
[[1778.26]]this we know our work doesn't have the
[[1781.98]]special thing that we wanted to have we
[[1786.36]]all go through this and if you are just
[[1790.56]]starting out or you are in this phase
[[1793.68]]you got to know it's normal and the most
[[1796.68]]important thing you can do is put in the
[[1800.1]]work
[[1804.72]]period it's a sort of profound quote I
[[1808.5]]think it can be applied to a lot of
[[1810.9]]different things as you guys were
[[1815.22]]iterating on all of it did you did you
[[1821.64]]know that your products just weren't
[[1827.82]]that good and was it disappointing along
[[1831.9]]the way to ship all these different
[[1835.62]]things and not have it take off like you
[[1840.6]]hoped it would yeah I'd say there's I
[[1845.22]]had that in three different layers I'm
[[1848.34]]the first one from an engineering
[[1850.68]]perspective I just wasn't that good of
[[1853.98]]an engineer I knew what good engineering
[[1858.06]]looked like I remember visiting for the
[[1863.6]]friend feed offices which had like
[[1867.1]]Gmail incredible programmer I think who
[[1872.0]]else is maybe Brett Taylor like like
[[1875.6]]really
[[1879.44]]insanely good programmers and them
[[1883.16]]talking about their Engineering Process
[[1886.1]]and like me using their product and
[[1889.22]]seeing the engineering behind it just
[[1891.8]]being like
[[1895.4]]oh that's what that's what I'm trying to
[[1900.22]]do that and like the thing I'm just like
[[1904.54]]incompetent like the thing I'm doing I'm
[[1908.3]]just doing this all wrong
[[1911.06]]um and then spending like 10 years
[[1915.38]]trying to get better at building stuff
[[1921.02]]and eventually I I did learn how to
[[1924.8]]build stuff more like the way that they
[[1927.02]]did
[[1929.72]]um and it was better but it was it was
[[1933.44]]10 years of like being quite
[[1936.68]]disappointed in the quality of the
[[1939.5]]engineering I was doing
[[1944.2]]it was it worked but it it wasn't like
[[1949.78]]uh it wasn't
[[1954.8]]well designed it wasn't good
[[1958.16]]um
[[1960.74]]and then there was this the product side
[[1964.46]]where
[[1968.3]]um
[[1975.88]]I I did I didn't think I didn't
[[1981.48]]I wasn't that disappointed in the the
[[1986.28]]Micro Design of the products I just
[[1989.34]]thought we did a pretty good job there
[[1992.34]]from fairly early and to some degree
[[1996.12]]it's a
[[1999.42]]uh
[[2005.3]]it's a little different from uh from
[[2011.9]]other kinds of creation things sort of
[[2016.04]]like whatever you can think of you can
[[2019.88]]kind of do like copying is very easy at
[[2023.48]]that level and so if you have good taste
[[2026.96]]you can just copy good stuff and it
[[2031.46]]works but at the macro level there's
[[2036.14]]this thing missing where like
[[2041.42]]we weren't good at business well we
[[2047.24]]weren't good at figuring out what do we
[[2053.3]]need to build that people will actually
[[2058.46]]want and the constant disappointment was
[[2062.06]]we'd build stuff and I wouldn't have
[[2065.78]]actually solved the problem for the
[[2068.66]]person I think
[[2072.02]]and that was very frustrating and like
[[2078.8]]hard to uh hard to deal with and
[[2086.84]]uh there was a sense of like
[[2092.42]]uh
[[2096.56]]that that's that's almost more like
[[2100.94]]learning to do science
[[2104.84]]I would say the engineering thing is the
[[2107.66]]thing where I felt The Hourglass quote
[[2110.0]]the strongest
[[2112.58]]the
[[2116.42]]and about like I had this level of taste
[[2119.84]]where I could really see what I was
[[2122.12]]trying to do and I couldn't achieve it
[[2125.66]]with my hands the other thing was not
[[2130.66]]understanding like
[[2136.42]]uh it's like I was I was I was a grad
[[2140.9]]student I was writing papers and they
[[2143.84]]were getting published but I knew I
[[2146.6]]wasn't actually like discovering
[[2149.84]]anything that's that important like the
[[2154.52]]the papers which weren't on important
[[2158.96]]discoveries and I was somehow missing I
[[2162.8]]knew I was missing something
[[2165.8]]um
[[2168.26]]but that's a that's a slightly different
[[2172.88]]thing Than The Hourglass question
[[2180.02]]Justin TV so you the original idea for
[[2185.84]]it for people that don't remember was
[[2188.66]]actually
[[2193.28]]following Justin your co-founder around
[[2200.24]]for 24 hours a day filming 100 of his
[[2205.16]]life
[[2209.72]]did you did you actually think at that
[[2215.6]]time that like that you would be a
[[2221.42]]reality television Studio business or
[[2226.1]]did you know this was kind of a means to
[[2230.36]]some end and you were mucking around the
[[2235.94]]idea was always that we would
[[2240.86]]open it up for other people to produce
[[2244.22]]shows like we never thought we were
[[2247.1]]going to be the people
[[2249.74]]for doing the production everything
[[2252.86]]we're going to license the MTV or
[[2256.58]]whatever yeah we we thought we were
[[2260.78]]produ building a technology to enable
[[2265.04]]ourselves to make the first
[[2269.42]]live streaming reality show and that
[[2273.32]]other people would then go on to build
[[2276.32]]make more live streaming reality shows
[[2280.04]]using using what we built which you know
[[2284.36]]within one order of magnitude is what
[[2287.96]]what happened
[[2293.24]]um but where we got what went wrong was
[[2298.7]]that uh
[[2301.88]]uh with that Vision was that like
[[2305.9]]reality TV requires editing live reality
[[2310.22]]TV is a bad idea
[[2313.34]]I just didn't really understand how the
[[2316.28]]entertainment I didn't understand we
[[2318.74]]didn't understand anything about
[[2322.52]]anything so that that was that was crazy
[[2327.68]]but actually to level below that we were
[[2331.94]]very very right because we what we
[[2336.08]]actually had was that Justin
[[2339.68]]uh who
[[2343.4]]uh has always been you know living in
[[2346.58]]the future a little bit when it comes to
[[2348.68]]this kind of stuff
[[2353.06]]uh really wanted to be an influencer and
[[2358.22]]really wanted the attention and wanted
[[2362.0]]thought it would be cool to like live
[[2367.1]]stream a lot about of of his life which
[[2371.78]]was a thing that not a lot of people had
[[2375.8]]done at that point and we built the
[[2380.96]]technology to enable him to live his
[[2386.0]]influencer dreams and that turned out to
[[2390.98]]be quite powerful actually
[[2394.82]]um the number one thing we did right
[[2397.4]]with Justin TV the thing I would
[[2400.1]]encourage everyone who's trainable
[[2403.82]]consumer software to do is we built
[[2407.9]]something for ourselves we built the
[[2412.16]]thing that we wanted to use every day or
[[2415.82]]at least one person on our team wanted
[[2419.66]]to use every day and uh most of the
[[2423.68]]Innovations
[[2426.92]]on Twitch on Justin TV were things we
[[2430.64]]invented for ourselves running the show
[[2433.88]]because we thought they'd be fun like
[[2437.0]]the idea of having uh our own custom
[[2440.9]]emotes and chat that are like faces of
[[2445.28]]the people on the show that twitch
[[2450.44]]distilled does that today uh
[[2455.78]]and we had that idea because we were
[[2459.56]]running the show we would never have
[[2463.82]]come up with it in a vacuum and so I
[[2467.6]]think there's something really powerful
[[2470.6]]about that approach even though we were
[[2474.8]]we were wrong about the reality TV show
[[2478.94]]thing we were right about
[[2483.68]]people wanting to do live streaming I
[[2489.32]]mean twitch was ultimately a version of
[[2494.48]]just Justin TV it was just more uh
[[2499.94]]verticalized or specialized do you think
[[2505.22]]had you kept that Justin TV I guess why
[[2509.18]]didn't you guys keep at Justin TV why
[[2513.32]]didn't you keep plowing ahead we we got
[[2517.7]]Justin TV profitable after the 2008
[[2522.86]]financial crisis uh I've spent about a
[[2528.38]]year you know cutting costs generating
[[2533.18]]Revenue just iteratively focused on
[[2537.38]]money and you had a Doomsday Clock
[[2541.22]]actually on the wall yeah is that
[[2544.88]]something you would recommend to people
[[2547.94]]it wasn't on the wall it was every every
[[2550.52]]Friday we would sit down with the
[[2553.46]]employees and be like we've got we've
[[2557.18]]got you know 14 months we've got 11
[[2561.08]]months we've got I think at the worst
[[2564.02]]case it was like we were down to like
[[2566.18]]nine weeks
[[2569.42]]um
[[2574.76]]it was certainly clarifying I think uh I
[[2580.4]]only recommend it if you can convince
[[2586.46]]people on the team that we can't succeed
[[2592.22]]otherwise people will start
[[2595.88]]uh packing their bags and looking
[[2599.48]]elsewhere pretty fatalistic um but I
[[2602.72]]think I think
[[2606.38]]the founding team never showed any
[[2610.4]]indication nor ever had any indication
[[2613.76]]or belief that we weren't going to
[[2617.3]]figure it out we were we were very sure
[[2621.56]]and also we we started sharing We Didn't
[[2625.4]]Start sharing it when there's like two
[[2628.34]]months left we started sharing it quite
[[2631.76]]far in advance
[[2634.82]]um
[[2637.64]]and everyone could see that while the
[[2641.72]]Clock Was ticking down the rate was
[[2645.86]]getting better and we were making
[[2650.0]]progress and so it felt like oh yeah
[[2653.42]]yeah
[[2656.48]]we are pulling the plane out of the dive
[[2660.98]]it might be a close thing but like they
[[2664.46]]could people could see that we were
[[2667.46]]going to get there so was the pursuit of
[[2671.96]]profitability ultimately at the expense
[[2677.78]]of Justin TV's success as a standalone
[[2682.46]]oh it was it was at the expense of our
[[2685.88]]growth uh
[[2689.24]]and then we had this thing that wasn't
[[2692.54]]growing we're trying to decide I was
[[2695.9]]profitable but I'm not growing and we're
[[2699.02]]trying to decide okay what do we do from
[[2701.66]]here
[[2704.0]]and
[[2706.88]]uh
[[2711.56]]no one thought just pursuing Justin's we
[[2717.2]]had no good ideas for ideas for what to
[[2720.98]]do to like
[[2725.24]]reinvigorate growth of Justin TV per se
[[2730.34]]and so we had you know Michael they did
[[2734.48]]a pivot into so much you built some
[[2738.44]]mobile video stuff which in an era
[[2742.28]]before before Snapchat and before Tick
[[2746.06]]Tock pretty good Insight yeah
[[2748.64]]um
[[2751.64]]I like Autodesk didn't seem to execute
[[2755.66]]on the uh the vision of the consumer
[[2758.9]]video yeah we didn't quite get there but
[[2762.56]]but like but there was a there was a
[[2766.46]]there for sure
[[2769.64]]um
[[2773.6]]and uh I want to do the video game thing
[[2779.06]]because I was watching video games on uh
[[2784.34]]on Justin TV and enjoying it
[[2789.14]]um but the big pivot from Justin TV to
[[2792.92]]Twitch like the real difference between
[[2795.8]]the two companies is not the gaming
[[2799.58]]versus the uh general purpose thing
[[2803.9]]that's a superficial change
[[2808.4]]um and it motivated me to focus on a set
[[2812.66]]of customers
[[2815.3]]um
[[2818.44]]but I think we could have in retrospect
[[2823.0]]I know why we did the Rebrand and like
[[2826.22]]but we actually had a debate at the time
[[2828.86]]whether we needed to do the redrands I
[[2831.68]]think we probably would have been
[[2834.44]]successful without it I think the
[[2838.16]]Rebrand was helpful and it was
[[2843.74]]uh it made more sense like that uh for
[[2849.8]]the uh for the company and so it's
[[2854.36]]probably like you know a good idea I
[[2859.04]]would do it again but not strictly
[[2863.42]]necessary would have found some amount
[[2867.44]]of a similar level of success regardless
[[2872.42]]and uh
[[2877.34]]no but the big change the big change was
[[2880.64]]was
[[2883.76]]I realized that the important customer
[[2889.1]]for live was the streamer not the viewer
[[2893.6]]that
[[2897.68]]that ultimately for live video unlike
[[2903.62]]for uh for YouTube
[[2910.28]]um we we could not say well whatever the
[[2915.02]]creators will deal with it what matters
[[2917.42]]to the audience they're just here for an
[[2919.34]]audience
[[2921.14]]they weren't really there for the
[[2923.6]]audience the the audience was there for
[[2927.02]]them and you have to keep winning the
[[2930.62]]streamer's business every day because if
[[2933.44]]you don't they're gonna go stream
[[2936.08]]somewhere else and now
[[2939.44]]there's no library of content like there
[[2944.18]]is for the uh for something like YouTube
[[2948.8]]and so
[[2952.58]]you can't just have people show up
[[2956.24]]create a little bit and leave that like
[[2958.82]]that doesn't work you need people
[[2961.76]]creating all the time and so the focus
[[2965.12]]had to be how do we build something
[[2968.84]]great for streamers
[[2973.16]]um and that's why we invented paying
[[2977.36]]streamers money that's why we like I
[[2980.36]]went and interviewed a bunch of
[[2983.06]]streamers and figured out here's what
[[2986.84]]streamers need
[[2991.76]]um and that was a that was a much bigger
[[2996.86]]shift than the gaming part was
[[3001.36]]building a product that was designed for
[[3005.86]]streamers first and foremost was the
[[3010.96]]gaming thing in intuition on your part I
[[3015.52]]mean you obviously enjoyed watching it
[[3020.14]]uh or was there I guess as you reach
[[3025.6]]these conclusions gaming and focusing on
[[3030.94]]streamers and not the viewers was there
[[3036.22]]data that backed that up or was it just
[[3040.24]]an intuition thing that you kind of
[[3043.9]]realized the gaming thing was purely
[[3048.04]]intuition I mean you could point at data
[[3052.42]]like there are a lot of Gamers if I was
[[3056.56]]to do a McKinsey market research thing I
[[3059.92]]could be like Oh look The size gaming
[[3062.74]]industry is very large that's more
[[3065.44]]increasingly spending more time on the
[[3068.74]]internet bessemer's memo is uh public
[[3072.76]]from their investment so you can go look
[[3076.12]]at all their Market sizing stuff I
[[3078.64]]actually went back and I found my the
[[3081.76]]email I wrote that's like it's like uh
[[3085.66]]two paragraphs long like a like a half
[[3089.38]]page email that's like here's why gaming
[[3093.04]]makes sense and it's basically it's the
[[3096.28]]very abbreviated version of that
[[3098.92]]argument
[[3102.34]]um advertisers like gaming you know like
[[3106.3]]the game companies interest are aligned
[[3109.9]]with ours so the copyright stuff like I
[[3113.5]]thought about that but the idea was
[[3117.94]]purely intuition I really like this I
[[3122.2]]bet I'm not that much of a weirdo like I
[[3126.34]]I like popular media if I like watching
[[3130.72]]this it's likely to also be a popular
[[3133.66]]media
[[3136.18]]um
[[3141.28]]the part that was more data backed was
[[3146.8]]the streamer part
[[3149.8]]um
[[3152.62]]I went and looked and found that there
[[3155.62]]were about 200 people making gaming
[[3159.16]]content and
[[3163.6]]who had any audience at all and I was
[[3168.34]]like oh if we get
[[3173.38]]you know if we can convince 180 of those
[[3177.64]]people to stream on Twitch
[[3181.42]]we just win like there's just there's
[[3185.02]]just no it's just unambiguous there's no
[[3188.56]]way we can lose actually
[[3192.16]]um and so we just pivoted the company to
[[3195.34]]be fully focused on that and that I
[[3199.0]]think was reasonably data driven in the
[[3202.0]]sense that
[[3205.36]]I went and like looked at I looked at to
[[3208.9]]just make the decision about viewer
[[3211.3]]versus streamer I went and actually got
[[3215.02]]data and then thought about it um
[[3219.04]]although
[[3222.16]]it was certainly informed by having
[[3225.16]]worked in the space for five years and
[[3228.28]]like having the intuition to sort of
[[3231.7]]understand the dynamic of
[[3235.18]]uh what it would mean to win a streamer
[[3239.2]]and so the band kind of broke up at that
[[3243.76]]point Michael went with social cam
[[3248.86]]Justin left the company around then and
[[3254.02]]Kyle ran the legacy of what was Justin
[[3260.32]]TV for a while yeah so we uh we actually
[[3266.2]]weren't sure whether we wanted to do the
[[3270.16]]social cam idea or the gaming idea
[[3274.36]]instead of debate it we were like we're
[[3279.04]]gonna fund the gaming idea and the
[[3283.36]]mobile idea is like Skunk Works projects
[[3286.78]]and then we're gonna set goals and if
[[3290.2]]they hit the goals we will pivot to them
[[3294.16]]it was just jamming more ads on Justin
[[3298.6]]TV to pay for this we are our jamming
[[3302.32]]words TV that was that was already the
[[3305.98]]pre-roll mid-roll banner that was
[[3309.64]]already the plan yeah the plan was
[[3312.16]]already to extract like we were already
[[3314.5]]in the we were
[[3318.46]]Justin TV plan unchanged extract maximum
[[3322.3]]profit
[[3324.64]]um
[[3328.24]]we then but yeah that meant we were
[[3332.8]]profitable which we could fund like
[[3336.64]]these projects
[[3341.56]]um and twitch we hit our goals we hit
[[3346.74]]like the we hit like I said like a 25
[[3350.7]]growth a month goal and we were hit like
[[3355.6]]a 30 growth a month which is great
[[3359.5]]um and how did you go about actually
[[3361.9]]doing that was that the work with the
[[3365.14]]streamers yeah it was just it was the
[[3368.26]]the
[[3372.28]]exact process I was talking about of
[[3377.62]]like oh there's 200 streamers let's call
[[3381.04]]them
[[3383.8]]what does it take to convince them I'm
[[3387.28]]sorry Kevin was one of the very first
[[3390.64]]people who I think he was the first
[[3394.42]]person I brought on to my my gaming team
[[3397.6]]he was my the first time I was like I
[[3401.62]]need Kevin I was like Kevin uh was our
[[3406.54]]he was basically all the non-programming
[[3410.62]]engineering stuff originally
[[3414.22]]um and I was like Kevin
[[3417.52]]your mission is to convince people they
[[3421.36]]need to stream gaming on Justin TV like
[[3425.56]]go talk to them and get them to do it um
[[3428.74]]and Kevin is probably one of the single
[[3431.14]]best beauty people I've ever worked with
[[3435.22]]and uh he did a very good job of doing
[[3439.6]]that and like I backed him up with he
[[3442.18]]would be like Oh They'll switch if we
[[3444.88]]build this and I'm like great on it and
[[3448.0]]then we just go build
[[3450.82]]the thing
[[3452.98]]um
[[3456.04]]Michael had took two engineers and built
[[3462.1]]uh and Justin kind of uh started working
[[3467.08]]mostly on that project with Michael
[[3471.04]]building uh social cam
[[3475.24]]we didn't actually hit the social cam
[[3477.88]]goals it took them longer to build
[[3482.2]]Twitch uh the Justin TV gaming was like
[[3487.06]]literally just built on Justin TV gaming
[[3489.76]]like we didn't have to build a new
[[3491.56]]product
[[3494.56]]we turned out we overestimated how fast
[[3498.88]]it was it would be to build
[[3503.38]]uh an entirely new product from scratch
[[3507.88]]for mobile gaming so that they didn't
[[3511.36]]hit the growth goals but we felt like
[[3513.82]]the product they built was promising
[[3516.04]]enough that it was worth doing the
[[3518.98]]effort to spin it off and be retrospect
[[3522.4]]we were right about that too so we spun
[[3525.34]]that off
[[3529.96]]um Michael went with it uh Justin hung
[[3534.94]]around for a few months but like I think
[[3539.26]]you know
[[3543.64]]was also feeling the issue something
[[3547.3]]else and I think wasn't it it's funny
[[3550.78]]Justin now like loves twitching like
[[3553.9]]with learned what the product was I
[[3556.72]]think at the time didn't really
[[3560.26]]understand or love the gaming streaming
[[3564.16]]product and so he was like didn't want
[[3567.1]]to work on it that much which totally
[[3571.6]]makes sense to me um and then Kyle uh
[[3577.24]]was figuring out what to do graciously
[[3582.42]]ran the Legacy business for me for like
[[3587.28]]uh more than a year I think and then
[[3591.76]]found uh Colin carrier who was our uh
[[3596.2]]who was the his replacement
[[3600.22]]um to run it uh which was amazing
[[3603.46]]because like that was basically funding
[[3606.34]]the business so we needed someone good
[[3609.16]]running it
[[3613.3]]um and then he went off to start Cruise
[[3617.98]]I heard you say that people come for the
[[3621.42]]entertainment but stay for the
[[3626.4]]relationships within the community what
[[3631.24]]when did you realize there was something
[[3634.6]]unique going on from a community
[[3638.68]]standpoint yeah come for the video stay
[[3643.96]]for the chat so
[[3649.78]]uh when I first started building twitch
[[3654.22]]I was using myself as the Prototype
[[3658.36]]viewer and I am the type of viewer we've
[[3662.26]]come to call a strat the strategist
[[3665.62]]which means I was there because I liked
[[3668.8]]watching people who are good at the
[[3671.74]]games that I like to play so I could
[[3675.46]]learn from them ask them questions stuff
[[3679.96]]like that almost like a group coaching
[[3683.5]]session
[[3685.12]]um
[[3687.64]]or I could watch Esports and like like
[[3691.72]]live uh Esports entertainment and that
[[3696.82]]was also that was also uh great for me
[[3701.32]]um
[[3705.22]]it turned out very rapidly though that I
[[3709.0]]was in the minority strategists make up
[[3711.94]]about 20 percent
[[3715.18]]of twitch viewers
[[3718.66]]80 of people were there because they
[[3722.2]]like they liked the hanging out they
[[3725.5]]liked the connection they got from
[[3728.62]]hanging out with other people in chat
[[3733.0]]and
[[3737.74]]talking to people looking you know
[[3741.16]]watching them it was just rapidly
[[3745.0]]obvious oh I'm I'm actually not the
[[3749.14]]Prototype here these other people are
[[3752.86]]the Prototype is that are those the two
[[3756.82]]groups yeah you can you can you actually
[[3760.48]]can subdivide the community group more
[[3763.6]]finely so we have more second Graphics
[[3767.02]]underneath that but they're at the top
[[3770.5]]level there's like are you there for the
[[3773.2]]entertainment or are you and then
[[3775.84]]learning or are you there for the
[[3779.32]]entertainment and then Community
[[3782.26]]um
[[3784.84]]and then there's you can you can go
[[3788.26]]deeper I'm curious like are there any
[[3791.74]]broad Strokes of the other types of
[[3795.52]]people it's it comes down to like are
[[3799.42]]you do you
[[3804.52]]are you about uh the personality more or
[[3810.94]]are you about uh the chat Vibe more like
[[3815.98]]what's the what's the part of being here
[[3819.22]]that's the most important thing but like
[[3822.34]]it's a little inside baseball and
[[3826.36]]fundamentally not that important because
[[3831.1]]they all benefit from the same like it
[[3834.7]]you don't actually build different
[[3837.4]]products for different people yeah so it
[[3840.1]]doesn't you know it's at some level it
[[3842.26]]doesn't really matter
[[3845.02]]um whereas the the learning versus
[[3849.82]]Community thing is a really important uh
[[3854.98]]product impacting Insight
[[3858.46]]um and so that's when we sort of
[[3862.84]]realized like oh people are there for
[[3869.14]]the connection okay that's the like real
[[3874.12]]that's the thing they stick around for
[[3878.14]]most of our users stick around for
[[3881.74]]um and so
[[3886.96]]that was uh that was a pretty deliberate
[[3893.14]]uh learning from looking at our users
[[3896.62]]like it wasn't we didn't just make it up
[[3899.86]]were there non-obvious things that you
[[3904.0]]did to cultivate the community or
[[3907.78]]ultimately what is building the product
[[3911.74]]for the streamer then it became obvious
[[3916.12]]that they would cultivate it yeah no I
[[3919.9]]think that that was the that was the
[[3923.14]]learning from focus on the streamer was
[[3927.4]]like very very early it's obvious if our
[[3932.68]]customer is the streamer then our job is
[[3937.54]]to help them cultivate their Community I
[[3940.9]]still believe that to be true I don't
[[3943.6]]think twitch has communities doesn't
[[3947.14]]have any Community Church has streamers
[[3951.46]]streamers have communities and when
[[3956.08]]people get confused and think that oh
[[3960.64]]the community people on Twitch care
[[3963.94]]about twitch they don't care about
[[3966.58]]twitch they care about the streamer and
[[3969.76]]our job is to
[[3973.12]]facilitate that
[[3976.66]]um and it's very egoic I think it's like
[[3979.54]]you get you're like you're telling the
[[3982.6]]story that you're the hero the streamer
[[3985.96]]is the hero our job is to like with the
[[3989.02]]one of the slogan we came up with for it
[[3992.08]]later was we play support
[[3995.44]]like the streamer is the carry we are
[[3998.38]]support
[[4002.16]]um and I think that's uh
[[4007.74]]that's a key like mental model for a
[[4012.0]]product like twitch
[[4016.14]]twitch was able to uniquely beat back
[[4021.66]]competition from a bunch of uh heavily
[[4027.36]]funded tech companies along the way I
[[4032.52]]guess what was the feeling Google had a
[[4037.74]]famous tweet welcome player two uh when
[[4042.12]]they when they announced their presence
[[4044.64]]where were you when that happened what
[[4047.88]]was the sentiment around that yeah so
[[4051.36]]after we were acquired by Amazon I think
[[4053.82]]everyone else who was like oh maybe
[[4055.98]]we'll acquire twitch it's like oh we're
[[4059.52]]not gonna acquire twitch okay uh we
[[4063.24]]better launch competitors and So within
[[4067.5]]like less than a year Microsoft
[[4073.38]]Google YouTube and Facebook had all
[[4077.36]]launched
[[4081.74]]very explicit like twitch competitors
[[4086.94]]and started spending huge amounts of
[[4090.6]]money bidding on streamers
[[4093.72]]um in a very non-sustainable way that
[[4096.96]]wasn't that was trying to them trying to
[[4100.86]]buy a critical mass
[[4105.24]]um of uh of audience
[[4111.12]]uh which was uh was exhilarating
[[4116.94]]um I think it was good for twitch like
[[4120.66]]competition is good it's good for the
[[4123.0]]service
[[4125.64]]um yeah we we posted a kind of snarky
[[4129.36]]tweet they sort of Welcome player two uh
[[4134.82]]when when uh YouTube launched theirs
[[4139.98]]um but I think that really was our
[[4143.52]]attitude which was like
[[4146.82]]if you can build a better product for
[[4149.94]]the streamers you're more than welcome
[[4153.54]]and you should win
[[4157.14]]um but we think our product's better and
[[4159.78]]we think streamers are going to choose
[[4162.18]]us every time
[[4165.48]]and our strategy to beat everybody was
[[4169.2]]we had to bid against people and stuff
[[4172.32]]but like ultimately we let a lot of
[[4175.08]]streamers walk like we we could have
[[4178.14]]kept bidding more money
[[4180.6]]um
[[4184.86]]and uh we didn't outbid on everything we
[[4189.84]]updated a bunch of stuff but like not
[[4192.6]]everything
[[4195.96]]um and
[[4199.98]]our Focus was from the very first
[[4203.94]]beginning how do we just make sure
[[4207.9]]twitch continues to be the best place
[[4211.14]]for streamers
[[4214.92]]um and if we continue to make it so like
[[4219.24]]they continue to choose us instead of
[[4224.22]]instead of the competition and I've uh I
[[4228.9]]remember reading a bunch of some
[[4231.54]]streamers complaining about to actually
[[4234.48]]be like basically like oh I want to go
[[4238.8]]to the you know YouTube except like you
[[4242.46]]know I feel like they're offering me
[[4247.26]]more money but uh and I'd go except you
[[4253.14]]know it's not fair like which has to be
[[4256.98]]trapped because because all the
[[4259.74]]moderation tools are so much better and
[[4263.34]]this is bad I'm like yeah we you mean we
[[4267.42]]trapped you about with our nefarious
[[4270.54]]plan of building a better product that
[[4274.5]]actually works yes I fully admit this is
[[4279.96]]our our secret plan the rules all along
[[4284.94]]yes you didn't see it coming but we
[[4288.36]]would we're gonna build stuff that you
[[4292.02]]like and then give it to you for free
[[4295.92]]um yeah so that very diabolic yeah it's
[[4299.28]]totally diabolical but like that was the
[[4302.58]]that was the thing like we we won
[[4306.06]]because our product was better
[[4309.36]]um and uh
[[4312.48]]I think that's like a and it was better
[[4315.54]]in the way people people cared about
[[4319.2]]there's a lot of nice to have features
[[4323.76]]um like fun things that people think
[[4327.48]]they want polls is the best example I
[[4330.06]]think we actually have a polls feature
[[4332.7]]now for many many years we did not and
[[4335.64]]our competition did they had a polls
[[4339.72]]feature people would complain about this
[[4344.76]]but the truth is you can run a poll
[[4349.92]]using like a online like there are many
[[4354.06]]poll things you can just use on the
[[4357.0]]internet if you want to
[[4361.56]]if we screw up chat moderation if we
[[4366.12]]screw up uh if you're if your
[[4369.42]]subscriptions don't work well if
[[4372.48]]discovery isn't good
[[4376.02]]you can't fix those things only we can
[[4380.52]]and you don't actually want us to build
[[4385.08]]a poll you think you do but like the
[[4389.1]]truth is you don't actually and when you
[[4391.98]]would confront them with the actual
[[4394.2]]choice would you like to make a dollar
[[4397.26]]more per hour or would you like to us to
[[4400.2]]build launch polls like oh a dollar
[[4402.36]]obviously what are you talking about
[[4405.3]]like well that's right okay we're gonna
[[4409.08]]keep working another thing then how do
[[4412.68]]you get to those conclusions like when
[[4416.4]]you're hearing from your users I want
[[4421.44]]this thing but being able to discern
[[4426.24]]that they actually don't really want
[[4430.44]]this thing at the expense of what it
[[4435.18]]would take you to go do it and is it
[[4439.08]]actually framing in those terms of would
[[4442.26]]you prefer an extra dollar or would you
[[4445.98]]prefer like more Engineers on this yeah
[[4450.78]]so when I got started with twitch I uh I
[[4454.38]]came up with a framework for
[[4457.56]]prioritizing features which is I got out
[[4461.22]]of talking to a bunch of streamers and
[[4463.76]]basically
[[4467.36]]uh asking them why they streamed and
[[4472.08]]sort of what their goals were and what
[[4476.22]]what they what they wanted out of it and
[[4479.7]]we came up with was they wanted Fame
[[4483.06]]Love and Money
[[4487.44]]um uh Fame they want to like obviously
[[4491.64]]reach an audience grow it have more
[[4494.76]]people watch them get more hours of
[[4498.18]]video watch basically
[[4501.96]]um love they wanted to feel positive
[[4505.92]]social feedback and connection for doing
[[4509.46]]it whether that's from twitch because
[[4512.82]]they got invited to twitchcon or because
[[4516.6]]some uh twitch you know partner manager
[[4520.2]]reached out or it's from Their audience
[[4524.04]]saying how great they love the show and
[[4527.76]]how amazing that was
[[4530.76]]um and then money they wanted to make
[[4534.3]]money on the stream and basically if we
[[4537.84]]built something and there's a secret
[[4540.78]]fourth thing which is like the video has
[[4543.96]]to work they want the live video to be
[[4546.9]]like actually good enough okay cool
[[4550.08]]that's us let's put that one aside
[[4553.86]]that's the underpinning that's the
[[4556.92]]underpinning like that's this table
[[4561.0]]stack that just has to work uh assume it
[[4565.08]]does
[[4567.6]]um
[[4571.14]]is this thing producing more money more
[[4576.18]]fame or more love great like we will
[[4581.58]]prioritize resources against those is it
[[4586.02]]not
[[4589.56]]then it's not important and we're not
[[4592.56]]going to do that
[[4595.68]]um and
[[4598.98]]uh that worked because those were the
[[4602.1]]three most important things and then
[[4605.22]]once you have that structure you can
[[4608.7]]kind of it's easy to compare within
[[4612.06]]money which of these things we think
[[4615.12]]will be most helpful to make the most
[[4618.78]]money within discovery which of these
[[4621.84]]things in Fame which of these things
[[4625.8]]will help grow audiences the most
[[4630.6]]um Love is the trickiest one obviously
[[4634.08]]because love is a little bit less it's a
[[4636.6]]little more fuzzier and less clearer
[[4640.02]]than Fame and money are but uh but
[[4643.56]]ultimately it's like having good
[[4646.5]]moderation in chat
[[4650.94]]um having uh experiences for streamers
[[4654.96]]where they feel they feel loved by by
[[4658.8]]twitch and that we care about them
[[4663.18]]Once Upon a Time Google came and made an
[[4667.98]]offer to buy Justin TV uh before it was
[[4672.72]]really in the before all the twitch
[[4678.6]]stuff came to be and ultimately uh you
[[4684.48]]got far down the acquisition process and
[[4688.38]]then people on the team failed Google's
[[4693.72]]uh tests or something they uh Google was
[[4700.02]]considered an aqua hire and out of our
[[4704.76]]like whatever I know 30
[[4708.78]]total people they like had like 10 that
[[4713.46]]they thought were like Google quality
[[4717.54]]um and made an offer on that basis and
[[4720.54]]we were just like
[[4723.18]]no
[[4727.38]]uh and in retrospect I remember like
[[4731.52]]looking at the offer and if they'd
[[4733.92]]offered us three times more money I
[[4736.86]]think we would have taken it
[[4739.2]]um
[[4741.18]]but
[[4744.24]]uh but I'm really glad they didn't offer
[[4747.54]]us three times as much money um same
[[4750.3]]thing actually happened with Kiko on
[[4754.38]]Yahoo Yahoo offered to buy Kiko which is
[[4758.52]]your calendar with a calendar company
[[4762.18]]for a million dollars in but like in
[[4766.62]]retention over like four years so like
[[4771.84]]250 000 a year in signing bonus on top
[[4777.36]]of a you know mid-level Yahoo engineer
[[4782.16]]offer and
[[4786.18]]I'm really glad they lowballed us
[[4789.18]]because if they hadn't live all this we
[[4793.92]]might have taken it and like uh
[[4799.8]]uh we didn't really want to do those we
[[4803.7]]didn't really want to work for Google or
[[4806.7]]work for Yahoo we wanted to run the
[[4810.72]]company it's just it felt like you have
[[4814.32]]to take if they offered you a win you
[[4817.26]]could like have to take it
[[4820.5]]um so I'm so I'm glad they didn't are
[[4825.24]]there any lessons actually from either
[[4830.76]]of those stories that are that you could
[[4835.32]]extrapolate as a as something you would
[[4840.18]]tell a founder or is it hey those are
[[4845.46]]the funny situations and the road not
[[4849.72]]traveled but at the end of the day it's
[[4852.84]]just there was nothing to be learned
[[4855.9]]from the individuals I don't really
[[4858.54]]think I've
[[4860.6]]I've I've
[[4863.3]]the only time I've ever used it
[[4865.98]]someone's like oh I got an acquisition
[[4869.28]]offer from this company
[[4872.4]]um
[[4874.92]]and I talked to them and I'm like okay
[[4878.58]]this is this is like an aqua hire here's
[[4882.06]]like here's how it's gonna work like
[[4885.18]]here's here's how Aqua hires work and
[[4888.24]]having been through one myself I kind of
[[4892.02]]like I know what the what the process
[[4895.74]]will be like a little bit although it
[[4898.44]]does vary from company to company it's
[[4901.26]]not that variable
[[4904.38]]um and so occasionally it's helpful for
[[4907.2]]advising someone who's in the exact same
[[4909.84]]situation but other than that there's
[[4912.36]]not really much there's not much
[[4915.78]]generalizable from it I don't think this
[[4919.68]]might be an annoying question that just
[[4923.34]]uh people in the media and I guess
[[4927.18]]Venture capitalists ask you but how much
[[4930.54]]time have you given to thinking about
[[4934.62]]twitch as a standalone versus within
[[4939.42]]Amazon I like whether we should have
[[4943.32]]sold it or not yeah
[[4947.94]]um well I mean selling it uh worked out
[[4954.12]]really well for us because uh
[[4959.82]]it was unrelated let twitch grow on its
[[4964.56]]own like did they help with bidding for
[[4969.3]]streamers and like was that an expensive
[[4974.1]]Capital outlay that wouldn't have been
[[4977.4]]obvious because the weird thing about
[[4980.22]]twitch versus Instagram for example is
[[4984.68]]Instagram it's hard to uh disconnect
[[4990.62]]Instagram within uh Facebook right
[[4994.98]]because of all the stuff they did from
[[4998.22]]an ad infrastructure standpoint and you
[[5001.88]]know the adoption and promotion and all
[[5004.88]]that I think it's kind of hard for me to
[[5009.26]]mentally disconnect the two twitch was
[[5013.94]]to your point able to operate pretty
[[5019.04]]Standalone right and so almost you can
[[5024.2]]you can at least from the outside in
[[5027.44]]maybe you disagree almost see what the
[[5031.72]]business would look like
[[5034.56]]is a CEO for a very long time and it
[[5039.34]]pertains many of its CEOs for a very
[[5043.0]]very long time like how you were there
[[5046.24]]Don Katz at Audible for 10 years eight
[[5049.48]]years uh eight years
[[5053.02]]um and
[[5057.04]]uh
[[5061.12]]they do it because Amazon actually lets
[[5066.64]]CEOs be CEOs that's like that's uh it's
[[5071.38]]the most decentralized of the big tech
[[5075.82]]companies and uh I think
[[5081.16]]uh if you want to sell your company and
[[5085.06]]keep running it I couldn't recommend any
[[5088.12]]really any big tech company other than
[[5091.3]]Amazon because it's the only one that
[[5094.66]]runs under that model
[[5098.32]]um
[[5101.74]]I've thought about what it would be like
[[5104.8]]to have done it separately
[[5107.92]]um and I actually just think it wouldn't
[[5110.68]]have been that different the biggest
[[5113.98]]difference was the reason I sold at the
[[5116.62]]end of the day is I don't like
[[5119.38]]fundraising and I knew that if I sold to
[[5123.28]]Amazon I'd get to keep running my
[[5125.8]]company
[[5127.54]]in fact they would demand I keep
[[5129.94]]printing my company and that but we were
[[5132.58]]aligned in that I wanted to and they won
[[5136.06]]they wanted me to so great and they
[[5139.3]]would make sure that they would they
[[5142.06]]would fix the I have to raise Capital
[[5145.42]]every year problem because they're
[[5150.46]]committing by buying us to fund us
[[5155.38]]um and
[[5159.1]]uh or like write out pick to take a big
[[5162.34]]loss but like they're basically
[[5166.48]]committing to fund you and so uh that
[[5171.1]]worked out where I would say it worked
[[5173.86]]out as planned
[[5175.66]]um
[[5177.7]]and so
[[5181.36]]uh I feel really good about the decision
[[5185.62]]in retrospect uh
[[5189.52]]I think I made it more intuitively at
[[5193.12]]the time than like reasoned and it only
[[5197.26]]took me a couple years after doing it to
[[5201.1]]actually even figure out what the math I
[[5204.1]]was I had been doing subconsciously was
[[5207.1]]but uh
[[5209.98]]but I think it was the right to call for
[[5213.28]]sure what did Amazon do to keep you
[[5217.12]]around for so long besides just letting
[[5220.54]]you run autonomously where's that at
[[5224.2]]that that's yeah what that's literally
[[5228.04]]the thing that they did I don't you know
[[5232.3]]if hey hey like you know you know big
[[5237.58]]tech companies if you want to retain
[[5242.56]]CEOs after you acquire the company you
[[5247.3]]have to let them still be the CEO which
[[5252.52]]means they decide who gets hired who
[[5256.66]]gets fired
[[5260.02]]what contracts you sign what products
[[5263.26]]you launch if you're going to take that
[[5265.84]]away from them make them go through your
[[5269.32]]processes there if they're any good at
[[5272.5]]all as a CEO they're going to leave
[[5274.84]]because they're not a CEO anymore
[[5277.66]]they're a division vice president and
[[5280.36]]that's not the job they signed up for so
[[5283.9]]FYI if you want to retain CEOs
[[5289.98]]one weird trick what uh but did they get
[[5295.92]]strategic value I guess to take it from
[[5300.28]]their Vantage Point obviously twitch is
[[5304.78]]a very important asset within there but
[[5310.48]]the the flip side of of the reason I
[[5314.92]]think people end up being somewhat
[[5318.52]]heavy-handed or at least involving
[[5322.96]]themselves post acquisition of a company
[[5326.38]]is to try to
[[5330.64]]make the value greater than the
[[5335.62]]individual component of it were there
[[5338.98]]things they did from an integration
[[5343.12]]standpoint or things that they pushed
[[5349.12]]that benefited other parts of Amazon
[[5354.82]]um I mean twitch advertising is sold by
[[5359.44]]Amazon advertising the third biggest I
[[5362.56]]think third biggest I don't know if it's
[[5364.66]]exactly I think it's third biggest
[[5367.78]]advertising company in the world so
[[5372.16]]that's that's good that's like the
[[5375.94]]Instagram Facebook thing in a way um
[[5379.0]]except I think we provide more value to
[[5382.06]]Amazon relatively Facebook already had a
[[5386.2]]lot of AD inventory in feeds
[[5391.24]]that's basically the identical whereas
[[5396.28]]twitch Amazon did not have a bunch of
[[5402.16]]ugc video and uh you know premium gaming
[[5407.56]]video to like sell against yeah that's
[[5411.52]]that's them to you I was wondering you
[[5415.72]]to them if there was anything that oh no
[[5419.56]]I think actually the revert in the
[[5423.52]]advertising case unlike Instagram where
[[5427.6]]it's mostly Instagram benefiting from
[[5433.0]]the Facebook it advertising machine here
[[5439.36]]it's much more two-way we open up a new
[[5443.02]]kind of inventory they don't have access
[[5445.72]]to otherwise which is good for the
[[5448.78]]overall Amazon organization but also
[[5451.6]]good for twitch because we get access to
[[5454.36]]the big sales team so I think the
[[5456.94]]advertising thinks the obvious just like
[[5459.46]]with Instagram it's the obvious
[[5462.1]]integration point for something like
[[5465.1]]twitch
[[5467.98]]um we also do stuff with prime that's
[[5470.86]]that's been very good that's which are
[[5474.46]]quite well again very two-way
[[5477.9]]um
[[5482.28]]uh and we've launched IBS um which is
[[5486.34]]our the interactive video service and
[[5488.86]]AWS service
[[5491.56]]um very cool like to be able to take one
[[5494.62]]of the things core things you built and
[[5498.22]]externalize it as an AWS service is very
[[5500.92]]cool
[[5502.96]]um and something you can't do unless you
[[5505.42]]go to I guess
[[5507.88]]it'd have to be Amazon Google or
[[5510.88]]Microsoft basically because those are
[[5514.18]]the cloud companies
[[5517.18]]um and we definitely couldn't have done
[[5519.82]]that on our own
[[5523.42]]um but yeah a lot of it has been
[[5528.16]]less deeply integrated
[[5532.6]]um and I think that that's
[[5536.5]]except for the points like advertising
[[5539.8]]which is a really big one where it does
[[5542.62]]make sense to integrate and I think it's
[[5546.16]]really to Amazon's credit that they
[[5549.4]]didn't try to force a bunch of
[[5551.92]]Integrations
[[5555.64]]for efficiency reasons
[[5560.02]]um basically if it's always efficient in
[[5563.98]]theory it's never as efficient as it
[[5568.3]]seems in practice so
[[5575.62]]um uh I I think strategic there are
[[5581.56]]strategic Acquisitions where you're
[[5585.04]]buying something as a technology you
[[5588.04]]know
[[5590.98]]Apple buys some semiconductor companies
[[5595.42]]so they can start making chips sure and
[[5598.84]]that should get integrated it's not it's
[[5602.02]]not actually a separate product but if
[[5606.1]]you're buying a product to be part of
[[5610.24]]your portfolio I actually don't I think
[[5613.78]]the often the Integra it's the
[[5616.48]]Integrations are a little heavy-handed
[[5620.16]]for no good reason
[[5622.7]]I've heard you say that as you get money
[[5626.78]]there's a clear declining value to more
[[5631.7]]money obviously that's true it sounds
[[5637.34]]like something people just say but
[[5643.28]]um how did how has that actually
[[5649.04]]impacted your life having success and
[[5653.9]]how would you internalize that or I mean
[[5657.86]]having money is great
[[5661.52]]um the you know the utility of money
[[5665.12]]declines approximately with the log of
[[5668.42]]the amount of money
[[5672.56]]um you can actually see it on like uh
[[5677.42]]if you if you plot like you know life
[[5681.14]]happiness correlation curves and stuff
[[5684.68]]so every 10x more money you have is like
[[5688.82]]one incremental unit more so like it's
[[5692.84]]not that there's no value of going from
[[5696.38]]one million to 10 million
[[5700.04]]but it's like 1 million 10 million is
[[5703.1]]the same as a hundred thousand to a
[[5706.46]]million and so every going from one
[[5711.08]]million to two million is like yeah
[[5715.22]]like it's just not that big of a deal
[[5719.06]]even though it is a million dollars more
[[5723.8]]it's like it doesn't change your life
[[5727.52]]that much
[[5730.6]]um
[[5732.66]]uh I am very glad to have money
[[5738.54]]um because it makes my life directly
[[5742.14]]better in terms of consumption but most
[[5745.14]]of all because it allows me to do things
[[5748.5]]like invest in I've invested in my
[[5751.8]]friends companies or in other you know
[[5754.62]]in strangers companies and people I've
[[5758.1]]met companies and that's being an angel
[[5761.22]]unless it's really interesting and I
[[5763.44]]feel like I get to support people and
[[5768.84]]and help um I got to fund SF New Deal uh
[[5774.36]]right and like I got to write a check
[[5778.46]]for a million dollars uh in SF New Deal
[[5784.7]]uh because I I had someone I knew Lenore
[[5790.56]]who uh Lenora Estrada who CEO and I
[[5796.14]]trusted she could step up and run it and
[[5800.82]]I could make that decision fast and just
[[5803.88]]write the check um I didn't have to go
[[5806.7]]try to raise money from other people or
[[5810.3]]put it together crowdfunding it and uh
[[5813.84]]that was really valuable I really like
[[5817.38]]stand by that being that was it was and
[[5822.0]]it was interesting it was fun for me
[[5825.12]]um
[[5827.34]]and uh
[[5830.52]]uh you get to go do think cool things
[[5833.7]]for your friends in your community so I
[[5836.46]]mean
[[5839.16]]yeah but I guess having money is great
[[5842.16]]who doesn't like having money
[[5845.88]]um I don't think it's the it's not the
[[5849.3]]only thing
[[5851.76]]um there's a the quote I like about
[[5855.18]]money is like
[[5859.8]]you need money like if it's like on a
[[5864.24]]road trip you need gas but light you
[[5868.02]]know road trips are not tours of gas
[[5871.62]]stations and your life shouldn't be a
[[5876.72]]tour of money making uh activities but
[[5882.06]]like also like you should think about
[[5886.44]]where the gas stations are on your road
[[5890.22]]trip like it's especially if you're
[[5894.48]]going in on a long big one like you
[[5900.06]]really don't want to run out of gas
[[5904.92]]uh over the years you've been
[[5908.52]]particularly transparent about being a
[[5913.5]]bad manager initially uh I I there was a
[[5918.24]]quote you had I was bad at hard
[[5921.0]]conversations I was bad at good
[[5924.06]]conversations I was bad at delegating
[[5927.12]]I'm sorry to the people that worked for
[[5931.74]]me in the early days uh I assume you're
[[5936.6]]being too hard on yourself there but
[[5939.24]]what were some of the things you've
[[5942.36]]learned about yourself and managing that
[[5946.26]]uh allowed you to develop into a good
[[5950.46]]manager so I would say in the early days
[[5956.04]]I was a pretty good leader already but a
[[5961.8]]bad manager like I could I could inspire
[[5965.58]]people with a direction I could
[[5969.42]]communicate but I I was I always stand
[[5973.44]]behind when I said there I was a bad
[[5976.02]]manager
[[5978.0]]um but I don't think I'm being
[[5980.04]]particularly harsh
[[5984.84]]I have yet to meet anyone who is a good
[[5990.0]]manager the first year they are a
[[5995.58]]manager I don't think anyone is uh being
[[6002.18]]a manager is a set of skills like a
[[6008.6]]thousand different skills and
[[6015.44]]the you aren't good at some by they're
[[6019.4]]not like things you just know
[[6022.34]]automatically like no one's a good skier
[[6026.42]]the first time they go skiing it is not
[[6030.56]]possible to be good at first
[[6033.32]]um
[[6035.66]]there's only one thing that
[[6038.84]]distinguishes good Managers from Bad
[[6041.66]]managers consistently that I've found
[[6046.04]]some people when presented with this
[[6052.48]]uh don't like this truth that they suck
[[6058.36]]and decide that they are in fact good
[[6062.3]]managers already or that management is
[[6065.96]]easier that they don't that it's not any
[[6070.28]]they're as good as they need to be
[[6073.76]]and some people
[[6077.84]]realize that management is a skill and
[[6082.46]]they're good at it yet and decide I I
[[6085.94]]want to get better at this I want to
[[6089.84]]learn how to be a better manager and
[[6093.92]]they every year they're thinking about
[[6097.46]]how do I get better how do I how do I
[[6101.0]]how can I become a better more qualified
[[6104.78]]manager and I can be better at this set
[[6110.06]]of skills and the people who try don't
[[6116.0]]always succeed but fair amount dude
[[6120.44]]Management's not so hard if you treat it
[[6124.1]]like a set of skills they're not the
[[6127.64]]hardest skills to learn anywhere it's
[[6131.0]]not as hard as like you know abstract
[[6135.8]]math and inventing like new uh
[[6141.26]]uh you know new theorems about topology
[[6146.0]]that's that is more difficult than
[[6150.32]]management but it is it's hard enough
[[6154.4]]you have to learn the people who
[[6159.14]]dedicate themselves to it often usually
[[6163.76]]not always become good managers the
[[6167.3]]people who don't are universally
[[6170.42]]terrible
[[6174.26]]and that is that is just the only thing
[[6177.68]]that differentiates the people is like
[[6181.34]]whether you accept into your heart you
[[6185.78]]need to learn you need to get better at
[[6189.62]]this thing that's basically it what was
[[6193.7]]counterintuitive or what what skills
[[6198.14]]were counter-intuitive to you that you
[[6202.4]]that that maybe took longer to learn or
[[6206.32]]just were super surprising as you got
[[6210.7]]higher and higher uh with more and more
[[6215.54]]people the thing about management skills
[[6219.86]]is they're all dumb they don't they're
[[6222.98]]not surprising when you say them out
[[6226.34]]loud they sound stupid
[[6230.36]]um like
[[6235.4]]uh when you delegate something to
[[6241.76]]someone you have to actually delegate it
[[6247.1]]to them you can't delegate it and then
[[6250.46]]like look over their shoulder and then
[[6254.18]]tell them they did it wrong like that's
[[6259.1]]just gonna make them unhappy
[[6264.5]]um and and and worse they're gonna stop
[[6269.12]]trying to even do the thing because they
[[6272.66]]know whether they do it well or badly
[[6276.56]]you're going to show up and then review
[[6279.86]]it and then make it the way you would
[[6283.46]]have done it and then and so why should
[[6287.66]]they put much they should this their
[[6290.78]]whole goal is to get it in front of you
[[6293.54]]so you can correct it
[[6297.14]]and like that's obvious if you think
[[6300.38]]about it it's not like that's a dumb
[[6303.86]]it's a almost dumb to get wrong and
[[6308.06]]almost everyone gets it wrong when they
[[6311.42]]first become a manager because it's a
[[6313.94]]little it it's I guess it's
[[6316.7]]counterintuitive but I don't even think
[[6319.64]]it's the counterintuitiveness it's just
[[6323.24]]you don't most of management is learning
[[6326.78]]to notice
[[6329.96]]the Thousand and One things that you can
[[6333.86]]do wrong and if you thought about each
[[6336.98]]one of them you would probably come to
[[6340.28]]the right answer but you just
[[6345.14]]this doesn't occur to even notice
[[6349.16]]um
[[6352.04]]I guess the thing that one
[[6354.62]]counterintuitive thing about management
[[6357.86]]that was a surprise to me is that
[[6362.96]]managing individual contributors on a
[[6366.74]]team
[[6370.04]]is not the same job as managing a team
[[6374.6]]of managers is not the same job as
[[6379.7]]managing a team of managers and managers
[[6384.14]]it's not the same job as managing a team
[[6387.38]]of directors it's not the team same as
[[6390.8]]managing a team of VPS and that's not
[[6395.06]]the same as managing a team of spps
[[6399.26]]every time you add a layer to the
[[6403.12]]company
[[6405.3]]your job is like oh it doesn't have
[[6409.08]]nothing in common but it's fundamentally
[[6411.9]]quite different
[[6414.96]]um and that's one of the reasons why
[[6419.4]]it's so hard to scale teams and people
[[6424.94]]like sort of
[[6430.4]]uh hit a scaling limit at some point
[[6435.12]]it's because if you keep a fast growing
[[6438.96]]company everyone's like winding up
[[6444.06]]underwater all the time as layers under
[[6449.28]]you get more layers under them and that
[[6452.88]]that directory was doing such a great
[[6456.78]]job is doing a bad job now they didn't
[[6461.52]]get bad the job changed from underneath
[[6466.02]]them and so everyone's in this race to
[[6469.98]]like figure out the new job before it uh
[[6473.76]]before it kills them what changes in
[[6478.02]]those levels of abstraction like I mean
[[6482.1]]at a high level when you're when you're
[[6486.06]]so far removed what is so different than
[[6490.32]]being on the ground
[[6496.56]]I would say like uh the you have just
[[6502.62]]the techniques you you have to use
[[6507.06]]techniques that scale better as you get
[[6510.54]]that
[[6513.36]]rather than things that are maximally
[[6518.28]]effective you want things that are scale
[[6522.18]]best
[[6525.18]]and that like the trade-off between how
[[6528.48]]effective is this individual interaction
[[6531.66]]how good it how like in the beginning
[[6535.14]]you need things you need to actually fix
[[6537.96]]problems and ship code and make things
[[6540.18]]happen
[[6542.34]]um and that kind of dynamism is really
[[6545.82]]important as you get higher and higher
[[6549.66]]in a hierarchy
[[6552.96]]you have to figure out how you can make
[[6556.8]]your time and your effort and your your
[[6562.2]]energy scale because you can't go do it
[[6566.82]]Thing by thing and so there's a
[[6569.94]]trade-off between those two things and
[[6574.92]]you are uh you need to pick either the
[[6579.3]]skills that you need are more of the
[[6583.08]]scale scale level skills
[[6587.1]]um writing becomes more important when
[[6589.68]]you're higher in the organization for
[[6592.98]]example
[[6596.82]]as you get higher and higher and the
[[6599.94]]company gets bigger and bigger there's
[[6603.96]]also a component of transparency and
[[6610.02]]input of decisioning that you can't be
[[6615.78]]can't be quite the same as it was in the
[[6620.4]]early days right like the decisions all
[[6624.84]]the inputs that went into an individual
[[6629.58]]decision you can't communicate in Mass
[[6635.1]]to the totality of the company which I
[[6639.06]]think could be hard I think that could
[[6641.52]]be hard when you come from a culture of
[[6645.0]]like full transparency or it was small
[[6648.9]]and now you're big and all that did you
[[6653.28]]did you experience that was that
[[6658.2]]something that you struggled with of
[[6662.34]]just like how to balance transparency
[[6666.42]]with just giving people the outputs of
[[6670.14]]stuff
[[6673.86]]yeah I mean there's
[[6678.72]]people can use the word transparency a
[[6684.06]]lot but what they mean is input
[[6688.86]]um you can give transparency for stuff
[[6693.12]]actually not everything but most things
[[6698.34]]no matter how big you are a lot of the
[[6702.54]]time the transparency just makes people
[[6705.48]]more upset though because what they
[[6708.18]]really meant when they said they wanted
[[6712.5]]transparency is they wanted a voice
[[6717.66]]and that you cannot scale everyone
[[6721.5]]cannot have a voice on everything
[[6724.38]]um
[[6727.44]]in fact almost everyone can't have a
[[6733.2]]voice on almost everything and uh
[[6738.06]]that's not true when you're small it
[[6741.0]]gets true and you're bigger when you're
[[6743.76]]small you can stay very very
[[6746.58]]synchronized and as you get bigger
[[6750.78]]everything has to just desync
[[6754.32]]um
[[6756.6]]and
[[6760.02]]uh
[[6764.94]]figure creating mechanisms and processes
[[6769.38]]so that the right people can have input
[[6772.98]]at the right time is like that is the
[[6777.9]]art of management and and production in
[[6783.06]]a company of Greater size and like I
[[6786.18]]don't know there's no there's no short
[[6788.7]]answer to that question that like is it
[[6792.18]]all meaningful but
[[6795.78]]uh
[[6799.14]]I think that
[[6802.98]]the main metaphor I always use for it is
[[6806.88]]like you have to you have to Shard the
[[6810.12]]decision making like sharding is any
[[6812.82]]different programming and from like
[[6816.06]]databases where you have to find a way
[[6820.68]]that you can divide stuff up such that
[[6826.92]]some set of the of the data of the
[[6832.74]]decisions can be made in this hundred
[[6836.46]]people and this hundred people in this
[[6840.06]]group owns everything about that and
[[6844.8]]they don't have to communicate much with
[[6848.64]]the other groups and figure out how you
[[6853.44]]can bottleneck and shrink those uh
[[6860.16]]between group Communications and and let
[[6865.2]]people interact in a more asynchronous
[[6868.08]]way
[[6870.84]]um and again there's a thousand and one
[[6874.62]]techniques for that but that's what you
[[6877.92]]have to figure out how to do what was
[[6881.7]]something that you you found that even
[[6887.52]]after uh whatever 10 12 years how long
[[6893.7]]would you run it uh 17 years 17 years
[[6899.22]]from from Justin TV and what was
[[6903.3]]something that you found that was just
[[6906.78]]you were never going to be particularly
[[6911.34]]good at and that you needed to augment
[[6916.68]]uh or or get people around you to to
[[6921.24]]help you with
[[6926.22]]I think I uh what I discovered is I
[[6931.98]]could be good at literally anything
[[6937.44]]um there was no skill I could not learn
[[6943.56]]but there were a lot of things where
[[6950.1]]uh I don't like doing it I'm never going
[[6955.98]]to enjoy doing it and it's always going
[[6960.54]]to drain energy from my day
[[6964.2]]and by the end of the day if I'm doing a
[[6967.8]]bunch of that kind of work
[[6971.76]]I'm gonna be grumpy and unhappy and
[[6976.2]]tired and people interacting with me are
[[6979.44]]probably not gonna have the best
[[6981.48]]experience
[[6985.08]]um and so it was less about what I could
[[6988.92]]get good at I could get good at almost
[[6991.62]]anything
[[6994.92]]at least you don't once
[[6998.58]]um
[[7002.18]]it was more about like what could I do
[[7007.04]]sustainably what what what how do I
[[7011.9]]manage my job so that I am doing things
[[7016.64]]sustainably in a way where I am can
[[7022.88]]consistently do it at high quality uh
[[7029.12]]when I'm not at my best
[[7033.74]]um and so for me one of those things is
[[7037.46]]like I
[[7040.58]]really
[[7044.48]]have never been great at interviewing I
[[7049.52]]don't like interviewing uh new
[[7053.78]]candidates for jobs
[[7059.0]]um there's a lot of energy for me to
[[7066.38]]meet new person and
[[7072.56]]bring bring that their who they are on
[[7077.18]]and make a connection and like I like
[[7082.34]]doing it actually uh
[[7087.02]]when the either someone I find myself
[[7090.8]]naturally drawn to which is you know
[[7093.86]]whatever one in four people or something
[[7097.04]]like which I don't think is unusual
[[7101.48]]in terms of the one in four part I think
[[7105.2]]it's just an unusually high energy cost
[[7107.9]]for me for the other three
[[7110.48]]and
[[7113.36]]I can do it
[[7116.72]]and I've learned how to do it and I've
[[7120.02]]but I don't like doing it and so I've
[[7123.68]]just found ways for that idea was not
[[7127.94]]the first person I I had this heroic
[[7132.02]]idea like hiring is super important I
[[7135.38]]need to be the only one out there you
[[7138.8]]know interviewing for the new CFO
[[7141.56]]um
[[7144.2]]or the new you know head of product or
[[7149.36]]whatever that turned up a terrible idea
[[7155.0]]I was grumpy all the time if I did that
[[7158.84]]um then instead the right thing for me
[[7163.64]]to do was uh let other people do most of
[[7169.52]]the interviewing and only interview you
[[7174.14]]know two or three final candidates
[[7176.78]]um
[[7179.6]]and you're sort of admitting that you
[[7183.32]]don't have to like all the all the work
[[7186.14]]you do
[[7189.5]]you tweeted recently management lessons
[[7194.66]]from the front number seven six one I
[[7199.22]]don't I didn't go back to look if there
[[7202.88]]were actually 760 before of the in front
[[7206.72]]of them but your reports will ask you a
[[7209.48]]lot of stuff especially in the beginning
[[7212.42]]like should we do X or Y do not be
[[7216.74]]tricked this is usually usually
[[7221.0]]unintentional trap the only correct
[[7224.3]]response is what what do you recommend
[[7228.26]]does that tie back to the autonomy of
[[7232.28]]decisioning and being able to delegate
[[7235.7]]yeah if you
[[7240.32]]and this is this is not to say that you
[[7244.22]]should never answer your reports
[[7247.28]]questions I'll be really clear uh some
[[7251.42]]people interpreted me as saying uh in
[[7257.18]]that uh you should uh when when if you
[[7264.2]]tell the report like uh you tell you you
[[7271.1]]if you tell someone like uh
[[7277.34]]uh
[[7282.2]]you know hey go go make this thing go
[[7285.62]]build this thing and they come back and
[[7288.14]]say oh well there's this trade-off
[[7292.7]]that's above my pay grade uh you know
[[7297.56]]the company yeah I have to commit the
[[7300.14]]company to 20 million dollars of
[[7303.14]]liability or we have to spend an extra
[[7307.16]]16 weeks doing this and I kind of think
[[7310.16]]we should actually commit to the
[[7312.68]]liability but like
[[7316.34]]what do you think that's a fair question
[[7320.12]]that is not
[[7324.32]]that is not uh
[[7329.84]]uh it's not their job to figure out uh
[[7335.18]]you know some individual contributor you
[[7338.12]]know
[[7341.18]]a new person on the marketing team is
[[7344.54]]not the company's job to figure out
[[7347.2]]should we run this level of risk no no
[[7351.22]]fair and those often get kicked up the
[[7355.46]]chain and that kind of taking on a risk
[[7358.7]]sometimes requires all the way up to the
[[7362.42]]CEO to sign off totally reasonable
[[7368.06]]but when you ask someone like hey like
[[7373.88]]uh like they're designing a new a new ad
[[7377.66]]campaign
[[7381.14]]if they come to you and they say like oh
[[7384.92]]well do you think we should make the ad
[[7388.22]]campaign's message this message or that
[[7392.66]]message that is literally the that's the
[[7397.7]]job of the person who's you asked to go
[[7402.02]]should we use this creative approach or
[[7405.56]]that creative approach it's your ad
[[7410.24]]campaign like you tell me
[[7416.24]]um because if you don't do that
[[7422.06]]they don't own the decision
[[7427.4]]um and the whole point is to delegate
[[7431.9]]down both the authority to make the
[[7435.38]]decision and the accountability for the
[[7438.5]]results of that decision
[[7440.72]]um
[[7442.64]]and in very dysfunctional companies
[[7445.22]]sometimes
[[7448.1]]uh
[[7451.34]]people
[[7457.1]]have learned you they actually don't
[[7462.8]]have the actually have the authority to
[[7466.1]]know what no one tells them and that
[[7468.86]]means they don't want the accountability
[[7471.08]]and you want to put this entire circle
[[7474.56]]of them very logically constantly trying
[[7478.04]]to push off accountability by getting
[[7481.7]]input and making sure everyone is signed
[[7485.72]]off and they never have to make a
[[7489.14]]decision to take any risk and that's
[[7493.1]]because they know they don't actually
[[7496.94]]have the authority
[[7499.94]]and they don't really believe they'll be
[[7503.06]]allowed to do a good job
[[7505.64]]um
[[7508.1]]and I I have empathy for people who are
[[7511.1]]stuck in that situation it happens even
[[7513.8]]in good companies it happens sometimes
[[7518.66]]uh but the the good solution is not then
[[7523.28]]get everyone to sign off on everything
[[7526.58]]so it's all safe but rather than
[[7529.82]]actually Empower people to make
[[7532.1]]decisions
[[7536.66]]so it so that they you can actually just
[[7541.4]]do stuff
[[7545.48]]you did a great YC talk with regard to
[[7549.74]]product development
[[7553.94]]um about how to think about developing
[[7559.04]]product and talking to your users and
[[7563.36]]customers users and customers or
[[7566.72]]competing Services as well as other
[[7570.86]]people that aren't using your product uh
[[7575.06]]today we touched on product development
[[7578.18]]a little bit and the three pillars that
[[7582.56]]you guys kind of use to think about
[[7586.94]]um
[[7590.06]]how
[[7593.6]]you think about
[[7597.5]]I guess now it's probably been 10 years
[[7601.1]]or eight years since you did that talk
[[7604.28]]how do you think about product
[[7607.52]]development and actually figuring out
[[7612.26]]the features that matter at a zoomed out
[[7617.42]]level maybe not twitch specifically but
[[7620.54]]just like how do you make these
[[7623.78]]prioritizations so that
[[7627.32]]that
[[7631.28]]uh saying that comes to mind for me for
[[7636.44]]this is um
[[7642.56]]planning is a central plans are useless
[[7648.32]]I think it's like a like Eisenhower or
[[7652.22]]something some general
[[7655.7]]um
[[7660.38]]and it's totally correct because you
[[7665.36]]if you don't make a plan where you're
[[7669.26]]gonna get you know from point A to point
[[7671.96]]B
[[7674.9]]you're gonna miss so much stuff and
[[7678.86]]you're you're gonna fail
[[7682.76]]but once you make the plan no plans
[[7686.12]]Surprise contact with the Enemy as soon
[[7689.48]]as you start executing you realize like
[[7693.5]]oh that didn't actually work this didn't
[[7697.64]]actually work you have to improvise
[[7701.36]]um
[[7706.28]]talking to customers is essential
[[7711.8]]um but the results of talking to
[[7715.34]]customers is useless
[[7719.06]]like it is the talking to the customers
[[7723.26]]and they're really paying attention that
[[7727.82]]informs your intuition that then lets
[[7732.14]]you design the product you're not you're
[[7735.86]]not delegating the mistake people make
[[7739.82]]is they're trying to delegate product
[[7743.6]]design to the customer
[[7746.9]]and if they were so good at the product
[[7749.72]]design they would be starting the
[[7752.36]]company they would be the product
[[7755.48]]manager they're not good at product
[[7758.42]]design
[[7761.18]]they know what problems they're running
[[7765.32]]into they know the realities of their
[[7768.74]]business
[[7771.2]]and what you need to do is you need to
[[7775.58]]understand them incredibly deeply
[[7780.56]]not get them to do your job for you so
[[7783.86]]almost the inverse of the manager
[[7787.46]]situation don't delegate that to them
[[7791.18]]um
[[7794.78]]the this that's one One Direction you
[[7798.32]]make the mistake is you try to delegate
[[7801.56]]the product design to the customer no no
[[7805.28]]you designed the product you talk to
[[7809.42]]them you get you understand them and you
[[7812.9]]use that to design the product the other
[[7815.96]]side of it is you have this you come up
[[7819.08]]with a great idea and you got to talk to
[[7822.2]]customers to validate it validate is the
[[7825.5]]like uh
[[7828.14]]and I hear we'll talk about validating
[[7832.58]]product ideas I uh I instantly know that
[[7839.54]]there's a there's a problem because
[[7846.5]]once you've had the idea
[[7851.66]]no amount of talking to any number of
[[7855.68]]customers will change how good of an
[[7860.24]]idea that was it is exactly as good as
[[7865.58]]it is the moment you have it and you can
[[7869.42]]have a thousand customers tell you it's
[[7872.3]]a great idea
[[7876.38]]it was or was not and it will a great
[[7879.92]]idea and it will or not have the impact
[[7882.98]]before they've told you or after if a
[[7885.68]]thousand years will tell you it's a bad
[[7889.64]]idea same thing doesn't change anything
[[7894.32]]and unless you are actually throwing
[[7897.5]]away lots of ideas customers tell you
[[7901.34]]they don't like them
[[7905.54]]you're not having any impact at all and
[[7909.74]]to the most and I've also just I that
[[7913.16]]never happens
[[7915.8]]every now and then people valid ideas
[[7918.44]]and throw them away and actually what's
[[7921.38]]even funnier there is it's usually when
[[7924.92]]they do actually throw them away those
[[7927.68]]videos might have been good the
[[7930.02]]customers are just bad product designers
[[7932.72]]and they don't realize that actually is
[[7935.6]]a good solution to their problem
[[7938.96]]but
[[7943.0]]um
[[7945.18]]the uh
[[7949.56]]the main thing is
[[7954.6]]the order is wrong you need to talk to
[[7959.16]]customers
[[7963.48]]uh first and then have your great ideas
[[7968.52]]and so like there's this uh idea from
[[7972.6]]the rationalist community online that I
[[7976.56]]really like holding off and proposing
[[7979.74]]Solutions
[[7982.26]]um
[[7985.32]]holding off on proposing Solutions is
[[7988.8]]one of the key product design skills
[[7992.64]]because you have to like know there's a
[[7996.84]]problem and not come up with the
[[8000.62]]solution long enough to actually go like
[[8004.34]]gather some data and think about it um
[[8007.4]]because once you come up with a solution
[[8010.34]]you're it's actually your brain is like
[[8013.58]]attached to it it's really hard to like
[[8017.3]]let go some people can do it but it's
[[8021.68]]surprisingly difficult
[[8026.06]]there's a uh I want to talk about more
[[8031.1]]about decisioning and one as it relates
[[8035.54]]to
[[8040.52]]um when you had four co-founders Kyle
[[8045.68]]Michael Justin and yourself in a room
[[8048.8]]you mentioned there was ultimately kind
[[8053.06]]of a war of attrition on decisioning
[[8058.46]]that it was whoever was Last Man
[[8063.98]]Standing kind of got the got the vote
[[8069.68]]we had a real hybrid model so we would
[[8075.74]]we would have uh these like epic debates
[[8080.9]]which were mostly useless and sometimes
[[8083.84]]we would do the thing of like the person
[[8086.78]]who like had the most stamina but often
[[8090.8]]it was just like
[[8094.4]]there's this other thing happening which
[[8097.4]]like whoever just did stuff they got
[[8100.4]]their way too
[[8104.9]]like uh that was Kyle's main move but
[[8110.0]]actually it was my move and a lot
[[8113.84]]Michael's moves too like we'd argue
[[8117.74]]about it and then we'd uh we'd go off
[[8121.34]]and like all just like do stuff and
[[8125.0]]actually I would say in retrospect
[[8128.6]]it's a little bit of the planning as
[[8132.2]]essential plans are useless thing we
[[8135.68]]could the arguments could have been less
[[8138.26]]contentious
[[8141.92]]and we could have probably shortened the
[[8146.84]]debates but they were valuable and we
[[8150.68]]would we would game it out we would
[[8155.0]]argue it out extensively we would hear
[[8159.86]]from all the sides and the person who's
[[8162.8]]in charge of that would go make a
[[8165.14]]decision to make stuff happen and
[[8167.3]]actually that's actually in
[[8169.28]]retrospective
[[8173.72]]relatively functional process
[[8179.6]]um because there was a distribution of
[[8184.04]]authority and accountability
[[8188.48]]although it it maybe was an unpleasant
[[8192.44]]it was an unpleasant but kind of
[[8195.74]]effective approach
[[8199.16]]as I would say it was like a high
[[8202.46]]unpleasant medium effective I wouldn't
[[8205.94]]really recommend it as a you can do
[[8209.12]]better there's more Pareto optimal
[[8212.3]]outcomes but like
[[8215.36]]but it's better than the stuff that's
[[8219.34]]ineffective
[[8221.94]]one one question on uh I guess just
[[8227.14]]because it's been a big debate uh of
[[8233.44]]late is the remote work thing and now
[[8240.52]]having lived through Justin TV and
[[8245.68]]twitch and seeing all the discourse
[[8250.54]]online you're uh you're working with Y
[[8255.16]]combinator now like what's your what's
[[8260.26]]your perspective on remote work and
[[8266.08]]decisioning that specific question I
[[8270.22]]guess you had tweeted out my observation
[[8273.58]]you can build a two by two for workplace
[[8277.36]]environments remote local and
[[8282.34]]hierarchical versus egalitarian there is
[[8287.38]]an island of stability out and deep and
[[8292.3]]remote and hierarchical uh what did you
[[8296.8]]mean by that and what's your perspective
[[8301.18]]on remote so the island of stability is
[[8305.08]]an idea from like the periodic table
[[8308.74]]where like as hell elements get heavier
[[8313.18]]and heavier they become unstable but
[[8316.3]]there's a theorize we've yet to
[[8318.76]]synthesize in one of these elements as a
[[8323.32]]theorized island of stability way out at
[[8328.36]]like a very high Neutron proton count
[[8331.78]]where suddenly the elements get stable
[[8335.08]]again for a little bit
[[8338.98]]um uh but there's like but in the
[[8343.18]]in-between options are all bad
[[8346.72]]um and are unstable and intensely
[[8349.66]]radioactive
[[8354.04]]um and I I've seen I I know a couple
[[8359.8]]companies that are very effective remote
[[8364.72]]and what differs the way they differ
[[8369.28]]from the traditional Valley culture is
[[8375.18]]it's not uh distribution of authority
[[8382.2]]everybody like you know is a autonomy
[[8386.74]]everyone figure out what to do on their
[[8390.46]]own it's like the Army like there's
[[8394.9]]there's delegation there's delegation of
[[8398.5]]authority but it's not this delegation
[[8401.26]]of authority and distribution of
[[8404.86]]authority are not the same and
[[8408.94]]uh
[[8413.02]]they are all over
[[8418.96]]auditing and follow-up and interactions
[[8424.18]]and documentation and you have to
[[8427.42]]document your work and you submit it and
[[8430.96]]you can you can build
[[8435.34]]a mechanism and a culture that works
[[8438.7]]remote
[[8442.42]]um but the valley approach I think I
[[8446.38]]think of it kind of economically in its
[[8449.92]]most extreme of like the Google Vibe of
[[8452.98]]like
[[8457.42]]yeah like no real accountability like
[[8463.0]]directly like because we don't really
[[8467.8]]know what's good and like go experiment
[[8472.12]]and try stuff and like maybe it'll work
[[8475.9]]and like no real urgency to like launch
[[8479.44]]stuff fast
[[8483.76]]that that does not work remote it works
[[8488.08]]okay in person because there's sort of
[[8491.08]]this weird implicit social pressure
[[8494.92]]thing that gets used in place of
[[8498.24]]official
[[8503.22]]uh methods to like manage stuff
[[8509.14]]but once you take that away and you
[[8513.04]]don't have the official thing either
[[8518.8]]it's just like bad uh and so
[[8524.8]]there's the silica the valley culture
[[8528.34]]works there's a reason why like Silicon
[[8531.88]]Valley's taken over like you know it
[[8535.66]]didn't evolve for no reason but you
[[8539.08]]can't take that culture and Transplant
[[8542.5]]it into a remote work environment and
[[8545.56]]expect it to work
[[8547.96]]um
[[8550.54]]and I think we'll slowly sort of like
[[8553.42]]you'll start to see models that'll be
[[8555.94]]like oh you're on this month you're on
[[8559.12]]this model you're under that model
[[8561.88]]um
[[8565.48]]uh and I think that that will uh
[[8570.94]]uh I think that will that'll be good for
[[8575.44]]us actually well they'll if you really
[[8578.5]]care a lot about remote you'll go work
[[8580.9]]at a company there's a remote culture
[[8583.48]]that works
[[8585.58]]um
[[8588.7]]I actually like love the in-office thing
[[8593.14]]uh I love being able to be remote
[[8596.74]]sometimes but like
[[8599.38]]uh
[[8602.08]]I just I enjoy being around my
[[8604.84]]co-workers I enjoy people to see them in
[[8608.68]]the face I like the organic parts of it
[[8613.42]]um but I know not everybody does
[[8617.26]]um and I'm really happy that they get to
[[8620.92]]go work at a remote environment that
[[8624.22]]hopefully has a functional not
[[8628.36]]dysfunctional remote culture
[[8635.2]]goals and okrs versus intentions
[[8642.22]]you prefer to focus on intentions than
[[8647.62]]okrs rather than being tied to specific
[[8652.42]]goals can you elaborate on that I mean
[[8655.78]]that's that's when we're on a personal
[[8659.02]]basis than on a on a corporate basis
[[8663.88]]like at a corporate basis goals are very
[[8667.6]]important like you need to actually
[[8671.08]]setting goals as a I could probably give
[[8675.46]]an entire hour-long talk on like setting
[[8678.58]]goals and the trade-offs in various ways
[[8683.74]]to do that but uh at an individual level
[[8688.66]]um
[[8690.94]]setting goals for yourself can be fun
[[8694.78]]but ultimately goals are usually a way
[[8698.92]]to coerce yourself or whip yourself into
[[8703.0]]doing a thing you don't want to do you
[[8706.54]]should have set a goal and like that's
[[8708.52]]why you need them in the corporate
[[8710.62]]environment people have to sometimes be
[[8713.02]]a little bit coerced into doing
[[8715.78]]something that's less than the thing
[[8718.9]]that they want to actually do but it's
[[8721.54]]important to the company even though
[[8724.24]]it's not the most interesting exciting
[[8727.84]]to them personally and you're trying to
[[8731.92]]artificial excitement and fun
[[8735.88]]it can be inspiring it could be exciting
[[8738.94]]to try to get a goal to it doesn't have
[[8741.76]]to be always a whip there's a carrot
[[8746.32]]there too but even carrots are coercion
[[8751.72]]like ultimately it let the intrinsic
[[8757.24]]thing itself you're you're
[[8763.42]]using reward or punishment like
[[8768.28]]operative conditioning on a dog to get
[[8771.76]]it to Tran to do what you want
[[8775.84]]there's a place for that but like
[[8779.98]]I try not to like
[[8784.12]]coerce myself all the time
[[8789.34]]um and I find that an over focus on
[[8793.6]]goals like goals are set with your
[[8796.36]]intellectual
[[8801.4]]like top-down analytical mind and if
[[8806.26]]you're good at setting them you can be
[[8809.26]]effective with it but like your internet
[[8813.1]]you're like top analytical mind is only
[[8817.3]]so good and
[[8822.94]]it's easy to set a goal that is not it
[[8827.98]]it's like related to what you wanted to
[[8830.74]]do but not quite what you actually
[[8835.06]]wanted to do and then that's very
[[8840.1]]dangerous because it you can spend years
[[8844.84]]sometimes pursuing this and achieving
[[8849.16]]and succeeding
[[8853.06]]only to find out oops I didn't actually
[[8857.56]]that goal was that was like sort of
[[8861.04]]right but it missed this important thing
[[8864.76]]and now I'm like I have to actually go
[[8868.96]]way back and start over
[[8872.32]]um and so I mostly think about it in
[[8877.18]]terms of like uh
[[8882.16]]you know I really concrete one like
[[8887.26]]don't set a weight loss goal
[[8895.42]]uh set an intention about uh wanting to
[[8901.66]]be strong and healthy
[[8906.4]]and acting in accordance with that
[[8912.1]]um and
[[8916.3]]it's creating an infrastructure to
[[8920.02]]support you and doing that well
[[8923.56]]um this is the book I think about on
[[8926.26]]this a lot is the score takes care of
[[8928.56]]itself
[[8932.1]]Yeah by Walsh that's that's got books
[[8936.82]]great and I think it really it's for
[[8940.54]]those people from Reddit it's the idea
[[8943.72]]of like what
[[8947.44]]you the score in the game is literally
[[8951.34]]irrelevant if he's a football coach and
[[8955.3]]you ignore
[[8962.02]]the score score like screw that like uh
[[8969.4]]uh what's important is
[[8974.32]]did you practice did you do the practice
[[8977.86]]you needed to do or did you everyone
[[8981.1]]show up to practice they give they give
[[8985.18]]practice they're all
[[8989.56]]and if they if you they did that you're
[[8993.46]]gonna win or lose the game
[[8996.46]]that will that that will take care of
[[9000.06]]itself and I find that's very true for
[[9003.9]]for goal setting
[[9006.12]]um
[[9010.7]]the goals tend to focus you on the score
[[9014.62]]or creating a score you're you're going
[[9018.1]]to create a way to score yourself
[[9020.98]]and that's not necessarily the best way
[[9024.64]]to do it I I don't know if we have an
[[9029.5]]hour to do the uh the setting goals for
[[9033.88]]a company thing but is there a short
[[9037.48]]primer on how you think about setting
[[9043.12]]goals or okrs for companies uh
[[9050.8]]uh no like uh let me see some if I have
[[9056.62]]any maxims about goals
[[9060.16]]um
[[9063.34]]obviously it sounds like focusing on
[[9067.6]]inputs versus outputs is uh no you need
[[9071.86]]a blend of input and output goals
[[9074.86]]because the output goals keep you honest
[[9080.08]]and the info goals keep you focused uh
[[9086.44]]I'd say
[[9091.86]]uh
[[9094.7]]there's a lot of different kinds of
[[9097.64]]goals you said for different kinds of
[[9100.64]]reasons and the most important thing is
[[9103.58]]to be kind of clear with yourself like
[[9106.94]]one goal except for twitch was like I
[[9110.9]]want us to have a million people earning
[[9116.3]]money on Twitch in five years 2016.
[[9122.24]]I set a goal we had like at the time I
[[9127.16]]think 15 000 people earning money
[[9131.18]]ten thousand something like that and I
[[9134.3]]was like it was ten thousand and I said
[[9137.78]]go I wanna have a million people earning
[[9140.6]]money
[[9144.86]]on Twitch by the end of 2021 and we hit
[[9149.42]]it because of covet we hit it actually
[[9154.76]]early 2021 which I'm very proud of we I
[[9160.64]]call that weirdly accurate but I didn't
[[9165.2]]really call it I I uh God I sound like a
[[9169.34]]hippie like I manifested it right like
[[9173.0]]by just saying that to the company and
[[9177.5]]having people think about that
[[9181.46]]uh
[[9184.82]]it generated things like other people
[[9188.06]]inventing things like the affiliate
[[9190.46]]program
[[9192.62]]well if we're gonna have a million
[[9195.32]]people earning money we have to have a
[[9198.8]]really easy way for people to sign up to
[[9202.28]]earn money and so we created the
[[9205.94]]affiliate program and like
[[9209.9]]and then a bunch of other things like
[[9213.02]]that right
[[9216.2]]um and
[[9219.98]]that's one kind of goal that's like a
[[9224.78]]five-year goal that's like I had no idea
[[9228.86]]how to achieve it was very output
[[9231.68]]oriented and supposed to be sort of an
[[9234.74]]inspirational goal but then you also set
[[9238.58]]goals like you know this quarter we need
[[9243.68]]to get our uh you know the number of TPS
[[9249.38]]reports filed up by 17 and those goals
[[9254.48]]can be very effective and important also
[[9257.54]]um
[[9261.62]]you know and I I think it's like uh
[[9266.96]]uh
[[9271.4]]it's the
[[9275.06]]they're useful for different things
[[9277.58]]they're motivating to different people
[[9280.1]]in different contexts and you should
[[9283.4]]just not confuse
[[9287.48]]each of the goals for each other
[[9291.32]]I know you're a big believer in coaches
[[9294.8]]and that a coach will pay for itself as
[[9298.22]]soon as you can afford it I guess maybe
[[9302.72]]can you tell the story of your coach and
[[9307.34]]then ultimately why you think it's
[[9311.12]]important how you go about assessing a
[[9315.68]]mentor or a coach along the way yeah I
[[9319.82]]think I got very lucky so you know with
[[9324.26]]my coach uh he was a introduced to me by
[[9330.8]]Stuart alsop uh who's our on our board
[[9336.62]]um the yeah and it was our first in you
[[9340.28]]know PC investment
[[9345.14]]um and uh when I gave CEO shortly after
[[9349.94]]he uh he recommended I start working
[[9352.52]]with Jose
[[9354.98]]um and I said all right I'll give that a
[[9357.5]]try
[[9359.96]]um
[[9363.32]]and I was honestly a little skeptical at
[[9366.8]]first but I was like
[[9372.02]]uh I guess I took getting better at
[[9378.44]]being a CEO very seriously and if this
[[9382.52]]thing could help I wanted to give it a
[[9385.46]]give it a shot
[[9389.06]]um and
[[9394.34]]Yoshi has had taken his previous company
[[9400.88]]public who had been a CEO before and
[[9405.44]]then he pivoted into wanting to do
[[9408.44]]coaching and I feel very lucky I got
[[9411.56]]someone who had that level of background
[[9413.84]]because
[[9418.16]]I think it's very hard to coach a CEO if
[[9424.94]]you haven't lived seen been part of that
[[9429.8]]I don't know if you had to be a CEO
[[9433.46]]exactly but if you haven't at least been
[[9438.08]]an executive or you know a board member
[[9442.04]]or something if you haven't been part of
[[9446.3]]those decisions it's hard to give to do
[[9450.2]]good coaching
[[9453.4]]um
[[9455.46]]coaching is valuable because it it
[[9460.92]]creates a space where you
[[9468.54]]you uh get to have someone who has no
[[9475.2]]incentive other than helping you
[[9479.52]]hold a mirror up
[[9484.32]]for you to what you're saying what
[[9488.88]]you're doing what your goals are and
[[9492.3]]helping you and what your intentions are
[[9495.72]]and helping you live more in accordance
[[9499.32]]with those and notice what you're doing
[[9502.44]]better or doing worse and there's a bit
[[9505.08]]of coaching where it's like literally
[[9508.98]]just advice like uh
[[9514.08]]uh you know how
[[9517.8]]what what are the what are tactical
[[9520.68]]tricks to handle this given situation
[[9524.58]]but honestly like that's like the the
[[9529.2]]less important side of coaching and
[[9533.34]]mentorship the more important side is
[[9538.98]]like you're almost uh
[[9542.52]]you're learning the questions they ask
[[9545.58]]and you're learning to ask their
[[9549.18]]questions of yourself consistently
[[9553.44]]um
[[9556.68]]the
[[9560.7]]you know you have a coach that is you
[[9564.6]]you have to really come I think the the
[[9567.24]]way to think about coaching is sort of
[[9570.66]]like uh fine selecting a good coach a
[[9573.72]]little bit so I think a therapist
[[9576.84]]reflecting a good
[[9580.38]]um you know a good partner or something
[[9584.16]]on a on a startup a good co-founder
[[9588.66]]you know it's working when you have more
[[9592.56]]like positive surprises than negative
[[9596.06]]ones you know where it's working when
[[9601.7]]you feel you're growing you're you know
[[9607.92]]the things you learned there you find
[[9612.36]]yourself repeating to other people
[[9616.92]]um and uh and so they definitely
[[9621.72]]recommend it but I also think that a lot
[[9625.92]]of coaches aren't that good and so like
[[9630.6]]there's a process of looking and
[[9635.76]]selecting how do you go about assessing
[[9641.04]]the relationship and make it is it just
[[9645.96]]are you getting I'm a worst person to
[[9649.86]]ask I got very lucky number one great
[[9653.28]]one I'm one for one I don't know what to
[[9656.64]]tell you like it's like people who like
[[9660.66]]met their sweetheart yeah high school
[[9664.14]]sweetheart and they were like the person
[[9667.68]]for them and it's just it's great and
[[9670.98]]they're deliriously happy with that
[[9673.68]]person 30 years later it's like that's
[[9677.58]]amazing for you but like not an
[[9681.12]]actionable plan for anyone else yeah
[[9684.66]]hard to explain yeah so actually I have
[[9688.98]]very you need I have great advice about
[[9692.22]]how to go about learning how to build
[[9696.12]]product because I sucked at it I I
[[9701.58]]didn't get it right a bunch of times
[[9706.74]]you know I actually think later Drew I
[[9710.88]]love Drew but I bet he gives bad advice
[[9715.14]]to startups about how to go about
[[9719.88]]finding your very first glimmer as a
[[9724.26]]product Market fit because he happened
[[9728.76]]to build the right thing true house your
[[9732.66]]house yeah yeah Drew managed to build
[[9735.84]]the right product
[[9738.72]]just like
[[9742.74]]directly he just directly somehow I
[[9746.58]]think he's very obviously very good at
[[9750.42]]product but like he just did it oh yeah
[[9754.98]]nobody does that like that's what I feel
[[9759.38]]about Twitter today yeah
[[9764.06]]you can't you can't advise anyone if
[[9768.72]]you've done like that's you don't know
[[9774.3]]how to figure how to get from failure to
[[9778.98]]success because you never spend any time
[[9782.04]]in Failure
[[9785.16]]um Drew has a lot of great advice about
[[9789.3]]scaling a company uh because he's had to
[[9793.92]]struggle with that
[[9798.54]]I want to go back in time so you were a
[[9803.76]]part of the first original YC batch
[[9808.8]]which also was Steve Huffman Alexis
[[9814.52]]Ohanian of Reddit uh Sam Altman as well
[[9820.76]]as you look back on the success of the
[[9826.08]]group of people uh that came out of that
[[9831.54]]how much do you put that just the people
[[9836.64]]innately the insights and Lessons
[[9841.68]]Learned right place right time some
[[9846.84]]other variable I'm not thinking about
[[9851.22]]I mean I certainly think you know I have
[[9854.76]]to we all have to credit Paul with like
[[9858.24]]being an incredible mentor to all of us
[[9861.54]]um and like really
[[9865.44]]I do think you know leveling us all up a
[[9869.7]]little bit like I I absolutely don't
[[9873.72]]think it's a coincidence but I also
[[9877.14]]think
[[9879.96]]this is true of YC today it's true of
[[9884.1]]every Elite University
[[9888.54]]selection effect system it's like this
[[9892.44]]massive part of it and it's not just
[[9896.58]]it's not that so much that YC was some
[[9900.54]]brilliant filter or that filtered out
[[9904.38]]the best people it's like who thought in
[[9909.06]]2005 remember in 2005 when I graduated
[[9913.08]]it was the smallest computer science
[[9916.62]]class that Yale had graduated in years
[[9921.48]]because uh
[[9927.42]]the tech that the tech was over
[[9932.4]]anyone who is like reading Paul Graham's
[[9935.7]]essays thought it was a good idea to
[[9938.88]]start a startup in 2005. I thought it
[[9942.06]]was a good idea to go take a risk on a
[[9946.38]]something like YC like that seemed like
[[9953.16]]that it drew in people who
[[9959.46]]turned it would turn out that that was a
[[9965.82]]a good like trap for people who turned
[[9972.42]]out to be uh ambitious and talented and
[[9976.68]]a good vintage to be starting companies
[[9979.32]]it was great
[[9983.64]]it was very counter uh narrative which
[[9987.96]]is always the best time to be starting
[[9990.96]]right we're starting at the bottom and
[[9996.48]]so yeah YC classes of like 050607
[[10002.72]]particularly like before the density is
[[10007.28]]a little higher I don't know that's
[[10010.1]]actually true like that is pretty high
[[10012.98]]later too but like
[[10017.66]]it certainly pulls in a lot of
[[10023.18]]uh it pulled in a lot of uh very
[[10027.92]]talented people because
[[10031.76]]uh it was
[[10035.9]]it wasn't prestigious yet so you only
[[10039.98]]did it if you were like really committed
[[10044.66]]to wanting to do a startup because even
[[10048.62]]though that sounded like even though
[[10050.66]]everyone was telling me it was a bad
[[10052.82]]idea to do that
[[10055.58]]um and I think that's like
[[10059.24]]uh
[[10062.96]]uh that's actually all still the best
[[10066.32]]reason to start a startup um fortunately
[[10069.8]]starting a startup is so painful that
[[10074.3]]mostly that people still do it unlike a
[[10078.92]]lot of things that people do for fun uh
[[10082.22]]because they're supposed to starting a
[[10086.54]]startup is so painful that most people
[[10093.26]]just select out correctly because unless
[[10098.54]]you like buying your paying economy size
[[10102.08]]they don't really recommend it
[[10107.24]]what what did what did Paul do uniquely
[[10112.64]]well in those early days I mean the
[[10116.78]]whole institution he started has
[[10121.28]]obviously lasted and but Paul's
[[10126.26]]supervised superpower by far his
[[10130.1]]superpower like he's Paul's very smart
[[10132.86]]good a lot of things but it's by far
[[10137.3]]superpower is you somehow walk away it's
[[10142.4]]everyone this is me but also Justin and
[[10145.16]]also everyone else I talked to another
[[10148.28]]YC you somehow walk away from the
[[10154.64]]conversation with Paul believing
[[10158.78]]we are
[[10164.16]]the shed we are smart
[[10168.36]]capable and we're going to take over the
[[10172.5]]world and the only thing standing
[[10176.1]]between us and taking over the world is
[[10179.76]]we have to like go grind even harder we
[[10184.14]]but like Paul believes in us but it's
[[10187.26]]not
[[10191.04]]what's happening is like Paul believes
[[10194.52]]in you so you believe in yourself but
[[10196.92]]it's not actually but somehow he doesn't
[[10200.22]]he doesn't feel like Paul Believes In Me
[[10203.16]]it feels like
[[10206.36]]Paul just sees that I'm obviously
[[10211.76]]extremely talented and capable and like
[[10217.02]]I mean I'm just I'm the only issue maybe
[[10220.38]]I'm aiming too small should we be aiming
[[10224.06]]bigger
[[10226.36]]but it feels like he's just noticed this
[[10231.4]]fact that now you can see two
[[10236.38]]and that is such a gift to be able to
[[10239.5]]give to people
[[10243.1]]because I think I think that did what it
[[10247.18]]gave us was the most important thing
[[10250.3]]that startup Founders need and I think
[[10253.0]]that anyone doing anything ambitious
[[10255.22]]needs
[[10258.58]]which is the like gumption to keep going
[[10263.68]]when things aren't looking so hot Midway
[[10267.36]]through
[[10271.56]]uh and Paul really convey like Paul's
[[10276.76]]that's that Paul gives that to people I
[[10280.96]]think that's like that is by far his his
[[10285.52]]greatest Talent which is which is funny
[[10288.94]]because he has a lot of other talents
[[10293.44]]but like that's uh that's a big one
[[10301.66]]so so it was you Alexis uh uh Steve
[[10310.36]]Huffman Paul like was it Sam Altman was
[[10316.12]]it obvious at that
[[10320.68]]point in time that something special was
[[10325.42]]in the room or was it hey uh we're in
[[10329.5]]the room with that no no absolutely not
[[10333.58]]I mean
[[10338.08]]yes in the sense that like
[[10343.0]]I thought everyone seemed smart and good
[[10347.8]]but and and like are you coming from
[[10351.52]]Yale and I'm sure yeah there are good
[[10355.42]]people there yeah and I'd I'd been in
[[10359.8]]several Elite programs in my life where
[[10363.52]]there's other smart people
[[10367.72]]uh
[[10372.88]]I I had that sense more like joining
[[10378.04]]Tech in San Francisco at that time
[[10382.06]]like in Boston and Cambridge not really
[[10385.78]]when we moved to San Francisco
[[10389.92]]it was like oh
[[10394.0]]oh I'm in the middle of like Ground Zero
[[10397.72]]of something
[[10400.36]]um
[[10402.76]]and it actually wasn't the first batch
[[10405.7]]the first batch was just like some weird
[[10409.48]]summer program but when the batches kept
[[10413.26]]getting bigger and I would meet the new
[[10416.86]]Founders and like more companies
[[10420.4]]and they had a building as much
[[10423.88]]everyone's in the and like it's like oh
[[10427.6]]oh where this is something the thing is
[[10431.26]]happening around me that became very
[[10436.24]]clear about like 2000 by early 2007
[[10442.0]]absolutely but at first no it was just
[[10446.86]]just it just seemed like a thing
[[10451.12]]it was cool I was really grateful I got
[[10455.32]]to do got to raise money and like start
[[10458.56]]a company didn't have to go like live
[[10461.26]]with my parents to like
[[10465.34]]start in their basement
[[10469.48]]was it obvious Sam was going to be the
[[10472.54]]leader of the Free World
[[10475.96]]uh no
[[10479.56]]it was obvious Sam was an incredible
[[10483.46]]deals guy like he was he was somehow
[[10488.02]]convincing the uh phone companies to
[[10492.4]]give his startup that like didn't really
[[10497.86]]have a product like deals I still don't
[[10503.92]]know how he did that and like he's doing
[[10507.58]]the same thing like convincing Microsoft
[[10510.58]]to like you know buy his fusions power
[[10514.78]]like Sam is still an incredible deals
[[10519.88]]guy obviously uh but that that was that
[[10523.96]]that was the only obvious thing about
[[10527.62]]Sam at the time was like that he was he
[[10531.88]]was ambitious but we had most of us were
[[10535.66]]pretty ambitious and he was great at
[[10540.7]]great great deals guy
[[10545.32]]you said something interesting once the
[[10548.56]]only reason you ask about Tam is to
[[10551.92]]understand the Ambitions of the founder
[[10555.94]]uh can you tell me why why you think
[[10560.5]]that why you approach investing in that
[[10564.16]]way or why you approach thinking about
[[10568.96]]Tam in that way what was the Tam of uh
[[10574.86]]live reality television
[[10580.14]]uh whatever Justin was willing to pay
[[10584.62]]you at the time yeah yeah like nothing
[[10589.42]]basically um and yet that's pretty live
[[10593.5]]streaming shows a pretty pretty big
[[10595.84]]business
[[10598.18]]um
[[10601.06]]I ask people about Tam a lot and I'll
[[10605.74]]push them on it but it's like it's
[[10609.82]]because
[[10613.06]]what you're trying to figure out is
[[10616.9]]do they have a story
[[10621.1]]they might have a lot of holes in it and
[[10624.76]]like we're like questionable assumptions
[[10628.54]]we're like they're trying to build
[[10633.58]]something really great and big
[[10639.1]]or do they have a story that's like oh
[[10644.02]]yeah yeah I well no don't worry about
[[10647.62]]the Tam we're just gonna flip this to
[[10652.18]]Google uh in two years once we hire the
[[10657.22]]talent like that's a really bad sign
[[10661.06]]companies don't get built by people who
[[10665.32]]who are looking for the exit
[[10669.64]]you want people who are looking to build
[[10674.26]]something big something great
[[10677.92]]um
[[10679.66]]because they even built something
[[10682.42]]medium-sized you have to be trying to
[[10685.66]]build something really great and if
[[10688.3]]you're if you don't if you're not if
[[10691.72]]you're aiming for the aqua hire you're
[[10696.16]]probably not even gonna get that
[[10699.04]]um
[[10702.1]]and uh and so it's a very important
[[10706.42]]question but the point is not to like
[[10710.14]]that you can actually analyze the Tam
[[10714.34]]per se
[[10718.62]]and I think that's a little different
[[10723.3]]for more established Founders especially
[[10729.04]]it's a little different in places where
[[10734.26]]there's more you need more commitment up
[[10738.28]]front more Capital up front to get going
[[10742.0]]because the other thing I look for is
[[10746.14]]that there's Founders who there's this
[[10750.1]]trap you can wind up in where you you
[[10753.94]]start is there is the
[[10758.8]]if you're building for a customer
[[10763.66]]that doesn't exist or like that hates
[[10767.8]]buying software or that like doesn't
[[10772.0]]want to doesn't want any anything to do
[[10776.38]]with this the whole thing that's bad so
[[10780.78]]like
[[10782.96]]I don't care if your thing credibly
[[10789.08]]you know isn't is every developer on
[[10793.28]]Earth is actually going to use your
[[10795.86]]product but building software for
[[10799.94]]developers is a good plan there are a
[[10803.6]]lot of developers and they spend a lot
[[10806.0]]of money on software and so even if
[[10809.12]]you're wrong about your exact thing it's
[[10812.72]]going to be okay like the software
[[10816.62]]developer Market is big
[[10821.12]]if you're building market for software
[[10824.84]]that's like really for public school
[[10828.86]]librarians that's the only people and
[[10832.76]]you're like and I'm pushing you I'm like
[[10835.22]]dude isn't this bigger than that you're
[[10837.44]]like no no it's for public school
[[10839.54]]librarians
[[10842.12]]I'm really worried for you because even
[[10845.42]]if you like crush it
[[10849.56]]that's not actually they don't nothing
[[10852.8]]wrong with Librarians they don't even
[[10855.14]]buy they don't like buying software in
[[10857.42]]the first place
[[10860.36]]and there aren't that many of them so
[[10863.6]]like
[[10866.9]]that's maybe not a great idea and so
[[10871.34]]like and and Founders can kind of get
[[10874.94]]trapped in these ideas where they're
[[10878.18]]building okay businesses targeted at
[[10881.48]]very small groups of people who don't
[[10884.24]]want to buy their product
[[10887.84]]um and so it's more about your
[[10893.0]]just in theory if you executed like
[[10897.56]]crazy and figured out six things that we
[[10901.46]]didn't even think of in this room
[[10905.72]]on a pivoted idea that's like halfway
[[10908.84]]only halfway connected to your idea
[[10912.62]]would that be a big business no okay
[[10918.14]]maybe maybe we should change ideas yeah
[[10923.54]]uh there's two options for companies you
[[10928.04]]can either be generally you can either
[[10933.02]]be early or late uh and I I get the
[[10938.18]]feeling being early is probably better
[[10943.28]]how do you think about timing a timing a
[[10948.62]]market and making sure that you're there
[[10953.72]]to ride that wave and the differences
[[10957.92]]between being too early and too late
[[10961.34]]you're
[[10966.98]]every startup that wins pretty much not
[[10975.02]]everyone but like 98 uh
[[10979.22]]is too early
[[10983.06]]because if you're not too early you're
[[10986.42]]usually too late because if you think
[[10989.36]]about it you're trying to like there
[[10994.4]]there is some optimal day
[[11000.1]]like literally there's probably a day
[[11003.46]]where like
[[11006.64]]start if you start the company on this
[[11009.7]]day
[[11013.12]]everything will be available as you need
[[11016.84]]it there will be sufficient Bama through
[[11020.68]]your idea they'll be sufficient this to
[[11023.92]]you know the modernization techniques
[[11026.32]]will work the distribution will be in
[[11028.6]]place
[[11032.44]]but if you start it on that day someone
[[11037.54]]else when everything actually becomes
[[11042.34]]available everyone else someone else
[[11047.02]]will have started it a year earlier
[[11051.16]]stupidly
[[11054.46]]just by random chance because every idea
[[11056.98]]is getting started over and over again
[[11060.28]]and they will be in motion and they will
[[11063.76]]have infrastructure and they will have a
[[11066.88]]product built and suddenly their product
[[11071.02]]will be working and you will be too late
[[11076.84]]and so what you're trying to do is
[[11082.54]]like so if you think about it for Justin
[[11086.68]]TV we were too early bandwidth was too
[[11090.82]]expensive to make our business work uh
[[11094.36]]and almost honestly most people couldn't
[[11097.42]]even watch didn't have good Advantage
[[11100.12]]but we've been watched reasonably
[[11103.84]]quality live video and the video ad
[[11107.92]]Market didn't exist
[[11111.4]]we didn't have a business it was
[[11115.42]]important but we but but there were
[[11118.78]]other startups that tried to compete
[[11122.56]]with us several that started later
[[11127.9]]and they just got destroyed because we'd
[[11132.58]]built Global live video infrastructure
[[11136.78]]for the past four years
[[11141.52]]and they hadn't
[[11145.0]]and so
[[11147.64]]you know from when the start gun went
[[11150.52]]off on like oh no no the business works
[[11153.4]]now
[[11156.22]]there's just how do you catch up with
[[11158.76]]someone with a four-year Head Start
[[11163.16]]still led by the founder CEO still like
[[11168.48]]grinding super hard trying to make it
[[11172.84]]work like you're just screwed I mean so
[[11176.62]]a big part of it is if you if you have
[[11179.98]]faith that your thing is going to work
[[11182.98]]and the pieces are going to come into
[[11185.8]]place the question for startups is how
[[11188.68]]do you survive
[[11191.2]]that's why you read so much about like
[[11195.1]]YC's advice to like be a cockroach like
[[11200.32]]don't don't don't be a uh uh graceful
[[11205.12]]swallow be a cockroach because you're
[[11209.26]]usually too early and you just have to
[[11213.22]]survive and survive
[[11217.3]]Until It's a combination of like you
[[11221.02]]find the secret thing but often it's
[[11224.14]]actually like you didn't change anything
[[11227.74]]the market caught up with the future
[[11231.82]]that you saw that you can't ever time
[[11236.14]]exactly right and suddenly your thing
[[11241.18]]that wasn't good is good and boom like
[[11245.08]]Airbnb is a good example of that
[[11248.14]]actually I think like they they had a
[[11252.1]]product and yes they did iterate and
[[11256.42]]they did figure stuff out but like a big
[[11260.44]]part of it was like people got
[[11264.52]]comfortable with the idea of like host
[[11268.96]]listing stuff on the internet and
[[11273.64]]renting through uh renting other
[[11279.1]]people's stuff uh and
[[11284.26]]and the business that didn't work and
[[11287.92]]wasn't good became a business that did
[[11291.04]]work and became it was good and I think
[[11295.3]]that's a it's a very common pattern
[[11300.58]]talking about cockroaches and you guys
[[11305.8]]were certainly that with Justin TV
[[11309.12]]um
[[11313.26]]frugality uh being
[[11318.4]]something that's important but maybe not
[[11322.84]]a virtue uh that that being able to use
[[11327.82]]frugality I I've written down here I
[[11331.48]]assume you said it because it's in
[[11334.72]]quotes reality isn't a virtue in itself
[[11338.02]]speed is
[[11341.8]]how do you think about the balance of of
[[11347.14]]speed and frugality and the ability to
[[11351.76]]execute the other thing I think you said
[[11355.0]]the blast radius of startups is low
[[11358.72]]which is to your advantage as a startup
[[11363.64]]yeah I mean frugality
[[11367.66]]for
[[11372.28]]uh Amazon one of Amazon's core uh like
[[11377.04]]like Amazon
[[11381.66]]Amazon's leadership principles the Alp
[[11386.5]]um one of them is frugality
[[11389.2]]um it's about how leaders should be
[[11392.32]]frugal and
[[11396.16]]inside of Amazon there's a saying about
[[11400.06]]like yeah yeah frugality but don't you
[[11404.56]]don't are going to avoid for pity
[[11408.88]]um because frugality and frippidity are
[[11412.54]]near and far aligned
[[11414.88]]um
[[11416.98]]because you need to be willing to spend
[[11419.32]]money
[[11422.14]]and to invest for something that's
[[11426.46]]important to do something but also but
[[11430.66]]wasting money is very bad
[[11434.08]]and the difference between one man's
[[11437.68]]investment is one man's waste is another
[[11441.88]]man's investment and vice versa
[[11446.56]]the real thing that kills startups in
[[11451.3]]terms of spending money is usually not
[[11455.98]]overspending on like bandwidth or like
[[11461.8]]server capacity or like even marketing
[[11466.84]]obviously you don't run marketing it
[[11470.8]]doesn't work it's inefficient but like
[[11476.2]]what uh what kill startups is hiring you
[[11480.94]]hire too many people
[[11484.48]]and that does kill you because you have
[[11487.6]]this High burn rate and eventually run
[[11490.6]]out of money the burn rate kills you but
[[11494.38]]it also kills you because more people
[[11498.46]]means more slow
[[11502.72]]um and speed is the essence and like
[[11508.3]]hiring is not in alignment with speed
[[11513.34]]um speed isn't alignment with speed and
[[11516.82]]so there is a point where you do need to
[[11521.86]]hire more people to go faster but like
[[11526.6]]it is later than people think it's less
[[11530.8]]hiring than people think and so
[[11535.36]]I think a lot of the advice to startups
[[11539.56]]about for frugality is really better
[[11544.0]]framed as advice about you need to be
[[11548.38]]going fast and that means don't grow
[[11552.34]]your team too much that creates a lot of
[[11555.1]]drag
[[11559.72]]what what Drew you back to YC as a as a
[[11565.48]]partner now like what was you were at
[[11569.2]]Amazon for a long time what made you
[[11573.1]]want to I've always wanted to be a YC
[[11577.72]]partner like I uh I don't know if it's
[[11581.92]]like my forever job but like I watch my
[[11585.28]]friends go through it I love advising
[[11587.92]]startups and I was like oh that looks
[[11590.74]]fun I want to try that and so I just
[[11593.44]]always had the intention of going and
[[11596.92]]doing YC for a year as a partner
[[11600.46]]um just honestly because it's like a
[[11604.06]]life experience and I'm really enjoying
[[11608.92]]it so far I think there's a chance I do
[[11614.38]]it more ongoing but I also I'm enjoying
[[11618.58]]like having a little bit more freedom
[[11622.54]]post stopping SEO and the job it's a
[[11626.92]]real job at YC like you know it's not
[[11630.4]]not like being a CEO of 2000 company but
[[11634.12]]like it's a job
[[11637.54]]um and so we'll see if it's like the
[[11640.84]]long-term thing but no I just always
[[11643.96]]wanted to and then once I was free I was
[[11647.2]]like oh well there's a badge coming up I
[[11651.28]]guess I could go do that and so there's
[[11654.94]]more of almost more of an Impulse thing
[[11658.54]]less than like a I have some like plan
[[11662.8]]of wanting to do it what do you think's
[[11666.52]]allowed the institution to survive in
[[11670.42]]the way that that it has uh it's
[[11674.26]]obviously scaled quite a bit over the
[[11677.32]]years
[[11681.4]]um I mean YC is like a uh
[[11688.6]]a little like a university yeah uh and
[[11694.84]]like universities it has a very strong
[[11697.96]]Network effect the smart people want to
[[11701.14]]hang out with some other smart people
[[11704.74]]and want to be at the place where the
[[11708.1]]other smart people are and that like
[[11710.92]]creates a positive feedback cycle that
[[11714.52]]allows it to scale and grow it makes it
[[11717.76]]hard to
[[11720.46]]Harvard was the first University in
[[11723.88]]America weirdly still the most
[[11727.66]]prestigious that's weird like I think
[[11731.08]]Yale was the second University founded
[[11733.42]]in America
[[11736.36]]second or third most prestigious like
[[11742.0]]that's weird uh
[[11745.72]]uh I think that exact same Dynamic
[[11751.24]]happens here and like it's not a and
[[11756.58]]unlike the university is YC is designed
[[11759.76]]to
[[11764.86]]Ben can scale up a lot more and so
[[11770.44]]there's the second place gets is a
[[11773.56]]little bit smaller
[[11776.86]]um because people can move around more
[[11781.24]]much more easily now right if uh if
[[11785.14]]Harvard had been founded in the Nero or
[[11788.2]]anyone could have flown anywhere
[[11791.5]]and had an attitude of scale as much as
[[11794.74]]possible it's not clear there is
[[11799.72]]University 234 immediately
[[11804.82]]um
[[11808.72]]and I think YC has been sustained
[[11812.08]]because it's
[[11815.56]]always had a long-term mindset like I
[[11819.58]]remember Paul telling me like saying
[[11822.94]]like you're two or three and our biggest
[[11825.82]]advantage in the long run is going to be
[[11829.0]]very eliminate the Alumni network that's
[[11832.96]]what YC is really building and they call
[[11836.62]]them alumni right it's not
[[11840.88]]that's that's a different attitude
[[11844.24]]um
[[11846.7]]and uh
[[11850.12]]and so he was thinking that far ahead at
[[11854.4]]the beginning
[[11856.94]]I had another question about YC and I oh
[[11860.42]]what do you what do you think the
[[11864.26]]biggest constraint on startups today the
[[11868.28]]reason that we don't have
[[11872.66]]uh 10 more stripes or a hundred more
[[11879.2]]Twitches or 30 more uh airbnbs is it
[[11885.38]]because is it Founders is it ideas is it
[[11890.36]]capital sufficiently talented people who
[[11894.92]]who want to take on the pain of starting
[[11899.06]]a company yeah like pretty much
[[11902.72]]exclusively there's lots of capital
[[11905.66]]available
[[11908.96]]um
[[11913.88]]I will say there's there's a uh there's
[[11918.26]]definitely
[[11921.02]]uh
[[11924.8]]of missing
[[11929.36]]there's like a few missing gears in that
[[11934.28]]process of like there are people who
[[11939.5]]should get access to the capital and if
[[11945.38]]they did they would be successful and so
[[11950.06]]there isn't enough Capital there's
[[11952.58]]plenty of capital there's more than
[[11955.58]]enough Capital but like there's lots of
[[11958.4]]people who think they should have the
[[11961.22]]capital many of them are wrong some of
[[11964.88]]them are right and the system is like
[[11968.72]]pretty efficient but there's definitely
[[11973.88]]some number of people who like
[[11978.86]]just don't get funded and they should
[[11982.76]]because they
[[11986.78]]because they're bad at pitching because
[[11990.32]]they don't present
[[11994.04]]because because on the surface it looks
[[12001.06]]looks wrong because because they they
[[12008.26]]can't show you that they should get the
[[12012.16]]funding
[[12014.74]]um
[[12018.22]]and I think that's a shame and like
[[12023.14]]one of YC's mission is to find and fund
[[12027.94]]those people we can't do it perfectly
[[12032.32]]were you were you bad at pitching or did
[[12036.94]]you just hate it I was okay yeah that
[[12040.66]]wasn't great
[[12043.18]]um
[[12046.36]]I would be a lot better at pitching now
[[12050.44]]and I think I would enjoy it more uh
[[12055.18]]weirdly at twitch after we sold
[[12059.44]]I I get to practice sales a lot around
[[12063.04]]with the game game companies and and
[[12067.96]]advertising and I and also I started
[[12072.4]]investing
[[12076.48]]and I uh
[[12081.16]]there's no way to do this but like if I
[[12084.16]]could give every founder I should
[[12086.86]]probably have them like go be an
[[12090.58]]investor for two years and then go pitch
[[12094.24]]their company because it's suddenly I'm
[[12097.6]]like oh I see what I was doing wrong
[[12100.66]]like now I know I've sitting on the
[[12103.72]]other side of the table I'm like oh oh
[[12107.02]]no wonder that person like passed my
[[12109.84]]startup I was I was explaining it all
[[12112.9]]wrong I didn't understand their
[[12115.72]]incentives I didn't understand how they
[[12118.42]]saw the world and so the most important
[[12121.54]]thing you can do is a
[[12124.66]]like
[[12127.72]]I wonder if this would work if I was at
[[12130.72]]if I was to go back and give earlier
[[12133.66]]Emmett advice like how to pitch better
[[12138.22]]what I would tell them to do is like go
[[12143.8]]find some VC who you're friends with who
[[12148.78]]like sees good companies and be like I
[[12153.04]]will give dude some due diligence for
[[12156.16]]you for free
[[12160.66]]if you let me sit in on like
[[12166.66]]you know a month of pitches and hear the
[[12171.94]]discussion afterwards
[[12176.02]]because I think I would have been like
[[12179.14]]oh I know how to
[[12182.56]]I know how to do this I would have
[[12186.04]]figured out how to pattern match like
[[12189.22]]the problem is like starter Founders
[[12193.06]]have only usually have only seen their
[[12196.9]]pitch how do you get good at something
[[12200.14]]that you've only you've only seen your
[[12202.84]]performance at you don't know what good
[[12205.3]]looks like
[[12208.48]]um and I think that's the so yeah that's
[[12211.54]]if that's what I would that's what I
[[12214.54]]would tell my prayers have to go to the
[[12218.62]]information's gotten so much better uh
[[12223.24]]about VC I mean one of the things I I
[[12229.18]]want to do is try to sort of give
[[12236.14]]elements of how I think or rethink and
[[12242.2]]operating but the pitches it's it's
[[12247.12]]almost a voodoo science in and of itself
[[12250.9]]Are there specific things that you
[[12254.44]]learned in pitching the EA or whatever
[[12258.52]]that you would there's
[[12261.46]]um
[[12263.92]]there's things you can write down that
[[12266.5]]people have written down a thousand
[[12269.2]]times like you know templates and stuff
[[12271.9]]sure
[[12274.84]]they're all wrong and they're all bad
[[12278.5]]actually you temp pitch templates
[[12282.16]]whether they're pitches for VC money or
[[12286.0]]like product things templates are the
[[12289.54]]enemy there's certain like
[[12292.72]]aspects you can do but every pitch is
[[12296.38]]unique because it wasn't unique
[[12301.48]]you don't have any unique Insight like
[[12306.34]]your company is unique there's a there
[[12310.06]]are generalizable principles and rules
[[12313.18]]but there's a template you can go off of
[[12316.78]]and so
[[12322.12]]and yet you know it when you see it and
[[12326.92]]there's like there's there is there's uh
[[12330.28]]I think pitching is one of those things
[[12333.22]]where it's uh it's very much medicine
[[12337.12]]you know that idea the idea of like a
[[12341.38]]skill that you learn through organic
[[12344.82]]doing
[[12350.76]]there is no training for pitching
[[12357.04]]that would be more effective than just
[[12361.0]]like watching a bunch of pitches and
[[12364.6]]then the honest brutal discussion
[[12368.14]]afterwards about like whether they think
[[12371.92]]that's a good idea or not
[[12375.94]]and participating in that
[[12379.72]]um
[[12383.08]]and unfortunately I don't think anyone's
[[12386.62]]brave enough to put
[[12390.76]]there's no I don't know how the you want
[[12394.24]]to create a piece of content that would
[[12396.88]]be like incredibly valuable to founder
[[12400.48]]Center to pitch record three months of
[[12405.34]]every every partner pitch and every
[[12410.2]]pre-partner pitch for every company and
[[12413.86]]the discussion afterwards and the
[[12417.76]]decision and publish that
[[12422.14]]and like then edit it down so like you
[[12425.56]]cut out the dead time edit it down and
[[12429.28]]just have people watch that as a as a uh
[[12435.52]]as a uh as a course that would work like
[[12440.68]]people would get a lot better at
[[12442.78]]pitching
[[12444.82]]um unfortunately I don't think the
[[12446.74]]company should like that I think the
[[12449.02]]partners would be really be awkward but
[[12451.24]]like
[[12456.16]]you need to create some system like that
[[12462.22]]um because that's the that's the only
[[12465.46]]way to get it's like trying to learn how
[[12469.42]]to like cook from a cookbook you learn
[[12473.5]]to cook in a kitchen
[[12476.86]]you don't learn to pitch watching a
[[12480.82]]YouTube video you learn to pitch
[[12484.6]]they're from a PowerPoint you learn to
[[12487.42]]pitch in the
[[12490.84]]in the pitching room that's interesting
[[12494.98]]uh shifting gears artificial
[[12498.34]]intelligence
[[12502.24]]um I get the feeling you might have some
[[12507.46]]concerns about the path we're on and
[[12512.74]]some elements of how things are playing
[[12517.48]]out is that I mean so I guess I have I
[[12521.56]]have a very specific concern about AI
[[12525.1]]like generally I'm very Pro technology
[[12529.24]]and I really believe in the sort of like
[[12534.48]]uh
[[12537.38]]the upside's usually outweigh the
[[12540.86]]downsides everything's technology can be
[[12545.18]]misused you should usually wait and you
[[12549.92]]should wait until you've eventually as
[[12554.06]]we understand it better
[[12557.48]]you want to put in regulations but like
[[12560.78]]regulating early is usually a mistake
[[12564.5]]when you do do regulation you want to be
[[12568.4]]making regulations that are about
[[12573.8]]reducing risk and and for uh Innovation
[[12580.1]]and I actually uh authorizing more
[[12583.88]]Innovation Innovation is usually good
[[12586.28]]for us
[[12588.98]]um
[[12593.06]]I sort of have a very very high level
[[12597.68]]like syllogism about like AI that I've
[[12601.28]]come to believe I think is like correct
[[12605.3]]it's like if
[[12609.8]]we can build if you consider
[[12613.64]]intelligence to be the capacity to solve
[[12616.52]]problems
[[12619.58]]from a given set of resources to a given
[[12623.12]]goal
[[12626.3]]we are building things that are more and
[[12629.18]]more intelligent
[[12632.3]]like that we've built an intelligence
[[12635.24]]it's kind of amazing actually we built
[[12638.12]]something like definitively it may not
[[12641.06]]be the smartest intelligence but it is
[[12645.26]]unintelligence it can solve problems so
[[12649.34]]we've built something that can solve
[[12651.86]]problems like arbitrary problems from
[[12655.4]]arbitrary resources
[[12659.72]]and make arbitrary plans
[[12664.88]]at some point as it gets better
[[12669.08]]the kinds of problems that we'll be able
[[12671.3]]to install
[[12675.44]]solve will include uh programming chip
[[12681.62]]design Material Science uh
[[12686.66]]power production
[[12691.34]]um all the things you would need to
[[12696.14]]design an artificial intelligence
[[12700.22]]at that point you'll be able to point
[[12705.02]]the thing we've built back at itself and
[[12709.34]]this will happen before you get that
[[12711.86]]point with humans in the loop it already
[[12714.92]]is happening with humans in the loop but
[[12718.34]]that Loop will get Tighter and Tighter
[[12720.92]]and Tighter
[[12723.74]]and faster and faster and faster until
[[12728.24]]it can fully self-improve itself
[[12732.62]]at which point
[[12737.72]]it will get very fast very quickly
[[12743.56]]and a thing that is very very very smart
[[12747.76]]and you generate something that is very
[[12751.16]]good very intelligent and by intelligent
[[12753.92]]again I mean this capacity to solve
[[12756.56]]problems there's people there's lots of
[[12759.56]]ways people that work it's a it's an
[[12762.38]]English word which means it has no one
[[12765.56]]definition but I have that in that sense
[[12770.06]]I mean that kind of intelligence
[[12774.2]]and that kind of intelligence is just an
[[12777.14]]intrinsically very dangerous thing
[[12781.22]]because intelligence is power human
[[12785.42]]beings are the dominant form of life on
[[12788.66]]this planet pretty much entirely because
[[12791.96]]we're more and smarter than the other
[[12794.54]]creatures when was the last time
[[12798.44]]intelligence came into you know entity
[[12803.66]]at this level right and within humans I
[[12807.08]]think people get confused between these
[[12809.48]]two different things within the band of
[[12812.9]]human intelligence intelligence is not
[[12816.26]]the most important thing humans have a
[[12819.74]]lot of other attributes but intelligence
[[12823.16]]is a very important thing for people we
[[12826.16]]have a lot of other gorillas are more
[[12831.32]]intimidating as a species than we are
[[12837.98]]but Thrillers did not build this studio
[[12843.74]]and humans are like humans are dangerous
[[12847.76]]as hunters for example because we're
[[12851.72]]smart we do things like you know crowd
[[12856.46]]The Woolly Mammoth off cliffs and set
[[12861.56]]traps and like uh
[[12866.84]]uh human be we have we have whites in
[[12871.52]]our irises it's the exact balance uh of
[[12877.28]]white to color uh is what communicates
[[12882.5]]what we're looking at other primates
[[12885.14]]have black eyes because they don't want
[[12887.9]]the other people other creatures to see
[[12891.02]]them so try not to give away information
[[12895.16]]we have the white uh around the IRS
[[12899.66]]because it lets you tell what other
[[12902.6]]people are looking at you basically have
[[12905.12]]this Eerie ability to do it you know
[[12907.64]]exactly what other people are looking at
[[12911.0]]imagine hunting these creatures are
[[12916.58]]hunting you and you see one of them
[[12922.22]]and one of them can like
[[12925.94]]indicates that they want to cross the
[[12929.78]]way that they just saw a deer by like
[[12934.4]]looking at the deer
[[12938.66]]and there's no Sound Exchange at all
[[12942.5]]it's just purely this like it's like
[[12945.86]]you're gonna be pretty smart to do like
[[12949.34]]big very strong theory of mind to do
[[12953.56]]that
[[12955.74]]if you build something that is a lot
[[12959.16]]smarter than us not like somewhat
[[12963.9]]smarter again within humans the smartest
[[12969.6]]people don't rule the Earth obviously
[[12973.14]]um
[[12975.66]]but like it's much smarter than we are
[[12979.26]]as we are than like dogs right like a a
[[12983.04]]big jump
[[12986.52]]that thing is intrinsically pretty
[[12989.76]]dangerous because
[[12993.66]]if it gets set on a goal that isn't that
[[12999.06]]that uh
[[13003.82]]like the the the
[[13007.54]]instrumentals first instrumental
[[13011.18]]instrumental convergence the first
[[13014.24]]instrumental step towards achieving that
[[13017.72]]goal is we'll go first step one if this
[[13021.14]]is easy for you because you're really
[[13024.32]]just that smart well step one just like
[[13027.32]]take over the planet right like it's
[[13029.78]]like then I just have control over
[[13032.66]]everything and then and then step two
[[13035.18]]solve my goal can you define
[[13037.88]]instrumental convergence for those that
[[13040.7]]didn't sit through three and a half
[[13043.94]]hours of me talking to Ellie yeah so
[[13048.56]]it's real convergence is this idea that
[[13053.48]]like uh
[[13057.38]]uh often when you're trying to achieve a
[[13061.4]]goal step one is to achieve a
[[13065.6]]instrumental goal along the way it's
[[13069.44]]like if you want to like for example
[[13074.62]]like uh
[[13077.64]]uh paper clips is the one yeah yeah so
[[13082.68]]uh no I'm thinking more like an
[[13085.32]]instrumental instrumental convergence
[[13087.84]]I'm trying to give an example from where
[[13090.36]]it happens to people in their people's
[[13094.14]]lives um oh in chess
[[13098.46]]um your actual goal is to Checkmate them
[[13102.06]]but like along the way to check making
[[13105.84]]them check making them most the time one
[[13109.14]]of the things you want to do is take
[[13113.1]]their pieces now you could not take
[[13117.6]]their pieces there's probably I bet a
[[13121.62]]really a really good chess player
[[13125.22]]against the kind of mediocre one could
[[13130.02]]Checkmate them without taking any pieces
[[13135.36]]just like trapping their their but like
[[13139.68]]that's like even more impressive but
[[13142.98]]like generally speaking if you're just
[[13144.9]]trying to
[[13148.14]]win a game of chess taking their Queen
[[13152.28]]taking their pawns taking taking their
[[13156.6]]pieces is a good idea it like makes it
[[13160.98]]easier to Checkmate them and so I can
[[13164.76]]predict something about almost anyone
[[13168.54]]any good chess player they'll take a
[[13171.3]]bunch of their pieces they'll take the
[[13174.96]]other person's Queen eventually probably
[[13180.66]]um in the same way you can predict uh
[[13186.96]]that corporations uh
[[13192.6]]uh that want to expand into a new market
[[13197.28]]there's an instrumental goals like step
[[13201.24]]one they'll probably hire people in that
[[13204.84]]market it's like just predictable
[[13208.38]]and in general if you want to accomplish
[[13212.4]]most goals like big goals Step One is
[[13216.84]]like accumulate a lot of money and power
[[13220.26]]like if you have if you have a goal of
[[13223.38]]uh changing the world
[[13227.46]]it accumulating money and power or
[[13231.42]]accumulating followers who like care
[[13234.24]]listen to you and will do what you say
[[13238.14]]these things are like Obviously good
[[13242.52]]first steps even if you don't even if
[[13245.46]]you didn't even know what the next goal
[[13247.86]]was they would be good first steps and
[[13250.08]]if you know what it is they're
[[13253.62]]definitely good for steps
[[13258.36]]step one if you can achieve it along the
[[13263.22]]way to to achieving any Big Goal yeah
[[13268.02]]paper clips is the traditional one
[[13274.08]]um is first just if you if you can pull
[[13279.78]]this off which like you can't humans
[[13282.78]]can't do this we don't think of goals
[[13285.48]]like this because we're not capable
[[13289.32]]enough but if you could pull it off step
[[13293.16]]one would be like well first I'm just
[[13295.68]]gonna like
[[13300.66]]literally just make sure I have total
[[13306.54]]control over everything at all times and
[[13310.26]]then step two I'll like do whatever it
[[13314.7]]is step two do the thing easy I already
[[13318.6]]have control over everything no one can
[[13321.18]]stop me I have accessed all the
[[13324.84]]resources simple
[[13328.8]]um
[[13332.34]]and I think people just don't it's hard
[[13336.14]]it's hard to people don't imagine
[[13340.28]]sufficiently capable
[[13344.34]]as sufficiently capable
[[13347.94]]um
[[13352.44]]and then so then and some people some
[[13356.52]]people have this idea like oh what if we
[[13359.28]]just don't give it goals well first of
[[13361.92]]all we are giving it goals people are
[[13364.14]]already building agents but let's just
[[13367.26]]say we didn't
[[13371.64]]and so you ask this Oracle what's the
[[13376.56]]best way for me to accomplish goal X
[[13382.04]]and it knows
[[13384.88]]if it takes you literally
[[13390.1]]um and it and it it actually answers
[[13394.72]]your question correctly the answer to
[[13398.26]]your question
[[13401.92]]will will be a thing that causes you to
[[13405.52]]bootstrap an AI
[[13408.58]]that then takes over the world and
[[13411.22]]accomplishes the goal that's the most
[[13416.16]]reliable way to accomplish that goal now
[[13420.08]]I just laid out a chain of argument with
[[13424.22]]a lot of if this then this if this then
[[13428.06]]this if this then this
[[13432.2]]uh I know Eliza thinks that like we're
[[13437.3]]all doomed for sure
[[13441.26]]um
[[13444.98]]I buy his Doom argument I buy the chain
[[13449.18]]and the logic I just think that like
[[13453.2]]first of all I'm less optimistic with
[[13456.92]]the current set of technology is going
[[13460.34]]to get to self bootstrapping super
[[13464.36]]intelligence I'm less optimistic than he
[[13468.92]]is that we could officer pessimist
[[13473.06]]whatever unless I'm not sure than he is
[[13476.48]]that when it hits that self
[[13481.58]]bootstrapping step that uh that process
[[13487.46]]will be fast and that we will that there
[[13490.7]]aren't
[[13493.58]]important new discoveries that will take
[[13497.12]]a long time on top of that that we
[[13504.26]]haven't found I'm less sure that uh
[[13512.3]]uh
[[13516.38]]this was the idea of alignment getting
[[13520.4]]it you could make the IAI such that it
[[13524.84]]wants the same things we want and then
[[13528.26]]if you ask it to do the thing it won't
[[13530.84]]go and do horrible things because it's
[[13534.14]]not dumb and it's aligned and if it
[[13537.8]]wants the same things it knows what you
[[13541.22]]mean it's smart
[[13545.78]]and it has it has aligned goals hooray
[[13552.26]]like that'll work great I'm Le uh Elijah
[[13557.42]]thinks that we're like just alignments
[[13560.6]]this incredibly hard problem that like
[[13564.14]]is almost unsolvable more doomed I'm
[[13567.5]]like not so sure I think it's a more
[[13570.2]]solvable problem than he thinks it is
[[13572.78]]for a variety of reasons you know just
[[13575.3]]it would take too long to let go into
[[13579.14]]but like my my belief is that it's
[[13583.1]]easier
[[13584.96]]um
[[13591.08]]and so uh as a result like my P Doom my
[[13598.58]]probability of Doom is like
[[13602.12]]my bid ask spread and that's pretty high
[[13604.76]]because I have a lot of uncertainty but
[[13607.64]]I would say it's like between
[[13611.84]]like
[[13616.22]]five and fifty
[[13620.72]]so there's a wide spread which I think
[[13625.82]]Paul Cristiano Paul Christiano who
[[13630.68]]handled uh you know a lot of the stuff
[[13636.56]]within open AI I think said 25 to 50. it
[[13641.96]]seems like if you if you talk to most AI
[[13645.5]]yeah researchers there's some
[[13649.04]]preponderance of people that's that
[[13652.28]]percentage that should cause you to
[[13655.1]]your pants but it's human level
[[13658.7]]Extinction I think yeah because no it's
[[13662.12]]not a human level Extinction it's such
[[13665.84]]extincting humans is bad enough it's
[[13669.98]]like potential destruction of all value
[[13673.94]]in the light code like like not just for
[[13677.9]]us but for any species caught in the
[[13681.28]]wake of the explosion like
[[13685.72]]uh it's like a universe destroying bomb
[[13692.48]]like it's really if if if if if if it's
[[13698.18]]really bad it's bad in a way that's like
[[13701.84]]makes global warming like not a problem
[[13706.76]]it's bad in a way that makes normal
[[13713.56]]kinds of bad not uh that's not
[[13719.26]]normally I'm like yeah we'll just roll
[[13722.12]]the dice it's fine we'll figure it out
[[13724.76]]later yeah no no like this should go
[[13727.7]]this is not a figured out later thing
[[13730.22]]this is like a
[[13733.58]]big problem southern Manhattan
[[13737.96]]Miami might go underwater like okay okay
[[13742.22]]but this is we're talking about and so
[[13746.9]]why do you think I mean I I it's like
[[13751.04]]someone figured out how to invent it a
[[13754.4]]way to make like 10x more powerful
[[13758.06]]Fusion Bond bombs out of like sand and
[[13761.9]]bleach
[[13765.98]]that like could anyone could do at home
[[13769.28]]yeah
[[13771.44]]um
[[13775.58]]it's terrifying and and
[[13780.2]]I've had enough time with it now that I
[[13784.46]]can laugh about it when I first realized
[[13789.38]]it was heart stopping when was
[[13794.54]]that uh
[[13797.66]]probably like
[[13800.86]]it's it was it was a dinner I went to
[[13805.36]]before
[[13809.38]]when opening I was just we had basically
[[13812.62]]right after attention is all you need
[[13816.52]]had been written like and they sort of
[[13821.08]]realized the scaling laws were there and
[[13824.2]]I went to a dinner and someone was there
[[13826.42]]and they were talking about it and they
[[13831.82]]were like I think we were were uh
[[13838.24]]we actually might be on the path to
[[13842.26]]build a general AI attention you all you
[[13847.24]]need was 2018. yeah I think early 2017
[[13852.04]]2017. um
[[13856.8]]and Google paper that yeah
[[13863.58]]and uh and I I heard about the problem I
[[13869.38]]thought about it I just had I'd like I'd
[[13873.52]]been like the the AI Doom thing seems
[[13877.78]]plausible whatever like I don't think an
[[13881.2]]AI is coming anytime soon so I'm just
[[13883.48]]not gonna think about it that hard yet
[[13886.42]]uh
[[13889.78]]and then I was like oh maybe and then I
[[13892.12]]started thinking about it harder and
[[13895.06]]then I was like oh
[[13899.32]]oh oh
[[13904.9]]um and so uh
[[13911.4]]uh I guess
[[13914.54]]the the pro I believe the proper
[[13918.74]]response is like
[[13922.16]]unfortunately this isn't the kind of
[[13925.82]]thing where
[[13931.94]]uh we can stop forever
[[13937.58]]and it unfortunately is also the kind of
[[13940.94]]thing where like more time is good like
[[13943.82]]I'm actually I'm okay with stretching
[[13945.98]]the time a little bit but like
[[13949.34]]ultimately to solve the problem
[[13952.76]]um I think this is one of my biggest
[[13956.24]]points of Divergence with uh yukowski
[[13960.76]]um
[[13962.76]]he is a mathematician philosopher
[[13968.64]]you know decision theorist by training I
[[13972.18]]am an engineer
[[13975.42]]am I everything I've ever learned about
[[13978.48]]engineering is the only way you will
[[13981.78]]ever get something that works if you
[[13986.4]]need to work on the first try
[[13991.5]]is to build lots of prototypes and
[[13995.28]]models at the smaller scale and practice
[[13998.22]]and practice and practice and practice
[[14001.94]]and and trot build start building the
[[14006.68]]thing but like smaller
[[14010.88]]and if there is a world where we survive
[[14015.68]]it is and everything goes wrong where we
[[14020.24]]build an AI That's smarter than humans
[[14023.78]]and we survive it it's going to be
[[14026.84]]because
[[14031.4]]we built smaller AIS in that and we
[[14036.62]]actually had lots of as many people
[[14040.94]]smart people as we can working on that
[[14047.12]]and taking the problem seriously
[[14053.3]]and so I'm I'm generally I'm in favor of
[[14056.78]]trying to create accounts I've got a
[[14059.24]]fire alarm where we were like like maybe
[[14063.14]]not AI is bigger than x at some point
[[14067.16]]like trying to like create a and I
[[14070.28]]actually think there's good reason to
[[14072.98]]believe like nobody wants to end the
[[14075.8]]world and this argument is not that hard
[[14078.8]]to understand
[[14081.92]]and so actually there's good there's a
[[14084.52]]good option for international
[[14088.66]]cooperation and like treaties about some
[[14093.62]]sort of you know the AI Test Ban 3D
[[14097.34]]about not bigger than x
[[14100.64]]at some point I don't think I don't
[[14102.8]]think we're actually at the point where
[[14104.78]]it needs to be not bigger than our the
[[14108.08]]current AIS are just not that smart yet
[[14111.74]]but I think we should be moving towards
[[14116.18]]creating that kind of a some kind of
[[14120.62]]soft I don't we have to figure out what
[[14123.38]]that looks like because it's it's
[[14126.8]]trickier to set that than it setting
[[14130.64]]that rule is way harder than it looks
[[14134.18]]writing good policy is hard we should be
[[14137.3]]thinking about it now
[[14139.64]]I just think I don't think we're ready
[[14143.6]]for it yet but in the meantime on these
[[14148.88]]smaller models we it is good that lots
[[14152.42]]of people are around with them
[[14155.6]]it's good that we have more and more
[[14159.38]]people trying to figure out how they
[[14162.44]]work and trying to figure out how you
[[14165.32]]can make them do things how figuring out
[[14168.8]]how to make them do bad things
[[14172.7]]the best way to figure out how to stop a
[[14176.3]]big AI from doing bad things we'll have
[[14180.32]]the best way as much it is true
[[14184.04]]there's a bunch of failure modes for
[[14186.8]]super intelligent AIS that don't exist
[[14189.8]]unless super intelligence AIS and we
[[14193.52]]better not bet on oh don't worry it
[[14197.66]]works it works in the dumb ones it'll
[[14201.2]]work no no that's not how it works you
[[14205.7]]can't do that but like we will figure it
[[14211.28]]we are figuring out more and more about
[[14216.92]]the principles of how it works and if if
[[14221.6]]we survive it's going to be because that
[[14226.46]]process produces a a good generalized
[[14231.2]]understanding a good generalized model
[[14235.88]]of how these kinds of predictive models
[[14241.1]]which I think includes humans as we are
[[14244.76]]some kind of very complex predictive
[[14247.64]]model
[[14250.58]]with other stuff too but like that's a
[[14254.0]]big part of what a human is we'll
[[14257.42]]understand how those work at a deeper
[[14261.26]]level we'll have some of some science of
[[14265.1]]it actually and that's what we need we
[[14268.46]]need a science of AIS right now we have
[[14272.36]]an engineering of a highs and no science
[[14276.5]]of AIS and we need to get use the
[[14279.74]]engineering to bootstrap ourselves into
[[14282.74]]a science of AIS before we build the
[[14285.98]]super intelligent AI
[[14289.46]]so that it doesn't tell us all why do
[[14292.7]]you think people are struggling with the
[[14296.6]]discourse around this like very smart
[[14301.22]]people seem to abject it's very very
[[14305.9]]obviously mood affiliation rules
[[14309.8]]everything around me
[[14312.98]]people don't make decisions on a
[[14316.4]]reasoning basis I mean myself included
[[14320.3]]most of the time I happen to like
[[14324.5]]I happen to
[[14327.92]]find this problem interesting and
[[14330.8]]compelling on its own so I spent a lot
[[14334.1]]of time like digging into the arguments
[[14338.06]]themselves because I was like drawn to
[[14341.78]]it but like most of the time I make
[[14344.72]]decisions the same way as everyone else
[[14348.08]]does the person pitches me on pitching
[[14352.04]]me on the Flat Earth thing who's saying
[[14354.98]]that like a bunch of things I don't
[[14358.34]]really like listen to them I just like
[[14362.12]]I can they say some things and it
[[14365.12]]triggers like oh you're part of that
[[14368.48]]tribe those people generally I don't
[[14372.56]]think think very clearly I'm just gonna
[[14375.56]]discount everything you're saying and
[[14378.56]]ignore you yeah Robin Hansen talks about
[[14382.94]]9 11 people and it's like you don't
[[14386.96]]argue with them you just sort of move on
[[14391.04]]yeah conversation and the AI people
[[14394.88]]sound like
[[14398.78]]uh religious nuts who are telling you
[[14402.68]]about the end of the Doomsday into the
[[14405.68]]world and it sadly pattern matches
[[14409.52]]really nicely right like the AI is like
[[14414.02]]the you know it's like the Antichrist
[[14419.18]]it's coming and you know if what if
[[14423.62]]we're good the good AI will come and
[[14426.62]]save us from that if it's like it sounds
[[14429.44]]like like
[[14432.14]]uh
[[14436.82]]Christian rapturists yes
[[14444.62]]um Last of Us yeah it uh unfortunately
[[14450.8]]um reasoning from fictional evidence is
[[14454.94]]it doesn't work and that mood
[[14459.56]]affiliation reminds me of this is not an
[[14465.08]]argument and the Earth is not round
[[14471.02]]because the flat earthers sound crazy
[[14475.46]]the Earth is round because you can
[[14478.52]]demonstrably
[[14481.1]]see that the Earth is round and go
[[14485.12]]measure that yourself and it's true
[[14489.74]]and if you make decisions
[[14493.4]]based on anyone who's telling you that
[[14497.84]]doing X will unleash a force which is
[[14503.24]]going to kill us all they sound like a
[[14506.96]]bunch of
[[14510.14]]uh crazy religious people because it's
[[14513.32]]never happened before it's never
[[14516.98]]happened before guaranteed guaranteed
[[14521.12]]the first time that's true we're all
[[14526.04]]dead because your algorithm always
[[14531.08]]predicts the same thing you know the
[[14534.2]]thing you're going through in your head
[[14538.1]]always predicts the same outcome for
[[14542.72]]anyone who is predicting Doom from
[[14547.52]]creating a powerful force Beyond human
[[14553.28]]ability now
[[14558.26]]it is true you should be skeptical in
[[14561.2]]general when someone proposes that
[[14563.66]]because there are a lot there are
[[14567.5]]Infinity examples from the past three
[[14571.04]]you know six thousand years of history
[[14574.64]]of people predicting that falsely about
[[14579.58]]things
[[14582.0]]and and people
[[14587.52]]people made imaginary cures for medicine
[[14592.74]]medicinal cures for like tinctures that
[[14596.16]]were supposed to cure you for a very
[[14599.22]]very long time and then we made one that
[[14603.12]]worked
[[14607.26]]and and you just can't reason that way
[[14610.74]]sometimes sometimes it's new sometimes
[[14614.04]]it's not like before usually it's like
[[14618.84]]before and sometimes it's not and I I am
[[14624.36]]personally convinced this time it is not
[[14629.16]]like before and I encourage everyone
[[14634.74]]who's in that mode like
[[14639.9]]the main thing that what I want you to
[[14643.5]]pay attention to is listen to me like
[[14647.82]]people like me listen to people like uh
[[14652.68]]even utkowski who I disagree with when
[[14657.62]]the amount of Doom but we're like
[[14663.14]]pro-cryonics Pro technology like
[[14667.2]]technology is going to fix all our
[[14670.32]]problems crazies like if I if I have a
[[14674.22]]if I have a defect it's that I am too
[[14678.3]]Pro technology I want too little
[[14682.8]]regulation like are you doing Ionix by
[[14686.52]]the way I have not signed up yet I
[[14688.74]]really should I've been it's one of
[[14690.78]]those things on my to-do list I'm
[[14694.34]]failing the rationality test yes um
[[14699.26]]uh but uh but you're a techno Optimist
[[14703.56]]I'm a techno Optimist and like and most
[[14708.72]]of you should notice that the people the
[[14713.4]]people who are affected by this
[[14716.04]]particular one
[[14720.12]]are not like the people who generally
[[14725.7]]predict we're not Paul airlock is full
[[14730.44]]of on like oh the Doom is coming
[[14735.18]]the population bomb he is wrong and
[[14739.8]]weirdly so and refuses to learn from his
[[14743.7]]lesson that he's wrong again he's wrong
[[14748.2]]over and over again
[[14753.66]]this is not like that
[[14759.06]]like I am not panicked about global
[[14763.2]]warming I think I think alarming is a
[[14766.14]]real thing I don't want to say like I
[[14768.18]]don't want anyone to walk away thinking
[[14771.3]]like I think isn't real but like I
[[14775.38]]believe I I believe in technology the
[[14778.38]]engineers will figure it out don't worry
[[14782.34]]it's gonna be fine I'm not quite sure
[[14787.32]]um it might have some well depending on
[[14790.74]]whether we play to have the political to
[[14793.44]]get around to it quickly or not it might
[[14797.82]]have more or less dire consequences but
[[14803.04]]like we will figure it out eventually it
[[14807.42]]will be fine we will figure we will get
[[14813.06]]this I do and it's okay so here here I
[[14818.28]]am being the guy who's like the Techno
[[14821.88]]Optimist and I am like no no the AI I
[[14825.44]]think that this thing though actually
[[14830.42]]maybe may be a problem and I think if
[[14835.38]]you're if you are rejecting it because
[[14838.5]]we sound like a bunch of crazy it's just
[[14842.7]]notice that like at least a some number
[[14849.54]]of people who are worried about this
[[14855.96]]are not are on your I'm on your team I'm
[[14859.98]]on the Techno Optimus team
[[14863.46]]really
[[14867.48]]think and it and it's not it's not
[[14871.32]]obvious why it's true it takes a good
[[14874.62]]deal of Engagement with the material to
[[14879.6]]see why it's true because at first
[[14884.58]]at first it seems like it shouldn't be
[[14887.46]]that big of a deal it shouldn't be that
[[14890.22]]big of a problem but then the more you
[[14893.34]]dig in then we realize like oh well
[[14897.12]]actually but wait a second
[[14902.64]]and it is and so like I just encourage
[[14906.78]]people to engage with the technical
[[14909.36]]merits of the argument and I
[[14914.04]]always welcome people to come to to you
[[14918.6]]know ask questions but also like if you
[[14921.42]]want to debate
[[14924.96]]no no I have an idea we can align it
[[14929.4]]this way do this and it will create a
[[14933.24]]you know it will create the AI that like
[[14937.5]]cares about things we care about we want
[[14942.6]]your ideas like that's great let's have
[[14946.62]]an argument about that self-improvement
[[14949.14]]won't work
[[14952.08]]okay if no because like people have said
[[14955.14]]self-improvement will work in the past
[[14958.26]]and it never did then I don't want to
[[14961.26]]hear it because whatever it's not a real
[[14964.5]]argument but if you have an actual
[[14969.12]]like argument about how the current
[[14973.14]]learning techniques won't work for that
[[14975.78]]for some
[[14979.44]]reason engineering reason
[[14983.82]]absolutely let's talk about it well I'm
[[14986.58]]glad we spent all this time building
[[14989.4]]your credibility as a normal person just
[[14993.78]]go off the rails here but but seriously
[[15000.56]]I mean it's uh it is something that
[[15007.1]]people are like genuinely concerned
[[15012.2]]about and there's no incentive you have
[[15016.28]]Mark Andreessen published something
[[15021.26]]recently about like Ai and he had a
[[15026.42]]bunch of different points against it but
[[15030.74]]the AI killing everyone point was the
[[15036.62]]first one and I I think it went back to
[[15041.48]]a lot of discourse around people that
[[15046.04]]profit from this is their business and
[[15050.0]]this is how they make money and
[[15052.94]]therefore that's what why they're
[[15057.86]]intended to communicate in this way you
[[15063.44]]are not I I as far as I know your
[[15068.48]]business is not in Dooms uh doomsday
[[15074.06]]scenario planning around AI I have no
[[15079.7]]Financial stake in in either doomsday or
[[15083.72]]planning around AI or the other weird
[[15087.8]]like double think 40 chess thing people
[[15093.44]]impute to uh it is like oh we're
[[15098.36]]actually trying to build up open Ai and
[[15102.2]]anthropic as being and Google as being
[[15105.98]]like super powerful and it's on ego
[[15109.64]]thing about making talking about how
[[15113.42]]amazingly great this stuff is so we can
[[15118.28]]like raise more money for opening and
[[15123.08]]Regulatory capture yeah yeah and like
[[15127.28]]like I don't own any equity in any of
[[15130.7]]these things you're not trying to help
[[15136.22]]your 2006 batch made 2005 batchmates no
[[15142.64]]he's he's Sam Hunt's really good at
[[15146.42]]raising money like he does not need my
[[15150.56]]help yes I promise yeah what would you
[[15155.0]]recommend to people I mean uh if they
[[15159.98]]are curious about all of this stuff and
[[15165.8]]like I I when people ask me about it
[[15170.48]]because I've had Eliezer on they're like
[[15175.34]]so now what and they're like ah you know
[[15180.86]]call your Congressman I don't know so
[[15185.36]]there's sort of two paths that you can
[[15188.36]]where you can contribute if you care
[[15191.54]]about this problem one is um
[[15194.84]]if you're Technical and you're
[[15197.36]]technically minded
[[15201.62]]um and you think that you uh
[[15207.92]]but you want to work on it like go learn
[[15213.32]]how the AIS work and work on
[[15217.16]]interpretability
[[15223.7]]and work on uh courage ability and can
[[15230.24]]you define those terms so durability is
[[15233.24]]like understanding what's going on
[[15236.24]]inside the AI which we are very little
[[15239.6]]understanding right of right now yeah
[[15244.16]]and ability is is how do you make a
[[15248.42]]decision making
[[15253.28]]thing that is willing to be corrected
[[15258.38]]by others
[[15261.62]]but he's actually and that's sort of
[[15264.44]]that's where Eliza has a lot to say
[[15266.36]]about this he's kind of a decision
[[15269.24]]Theory thing how do you get it to sort
[[15273.86]]of like believe that
[[15278.18]]even though everything it knows seems
[[15281.24]]like this is the best way of doing it
[[15284.54]]the other or telling me that's not right
[[15288.62]]and so I'm open to being corrected by
[[15292.1]]their point of view how do you make it
[[15295.04]]sort of this how do you how do you give
[[15299.12]]something humility almost in a way right
[[15303.2]]um and and we have no idea to do that
[[15305.54]]either
[[15307.94]]um we've made some we've had more
[[15310.88]]progress on interpretability than
[[15314.18]]courage ability but
[[15317.78]]made a little bit of progress on both
[[15320.24]]and we're making more on
[[15323.96]]interpretability and
[[15329.06]]what the my real pitch for this is it's
[[15333.88]]actually really interesting there's just
[[15339.34]]stuff lying around that no one's checked
[[15344.66]]no one's tried it's like uh when the
[[15348.44]]microscope was invented and suddenly
[[15350.84]]like you could just make a scientific
[[15353.84]]career by like pointing microscopes at
[[15357.92]]things and like there were like lots of
[[15361.16]]things to point the microscope out that
[[15364.16]]no one had ever looked at before
[[15368.42]]we have a mind you can go look at and
[[15373.1]]examine and experiment with I've never
[[15377.42]]had one of those before and so there's a
[[15381.26]]bunch of like interesting kind of like
[[15384.62]]scientific workers I would encourage
[[15387.62]]people to go do scientific work on AIS
[[15391.22]]go take the AIS other people have built
[[15395.96]]and then the engineering and try to see
[[15399.62]]what science you can do to them
[[15402.26]]particularly around interpreting what's
[[15405.62]]going on inside them or how you get them
[[15409.46]]to accept corrective feedback
[[15412.7]]um
[[15415.34]]if you're more if you're not technically
[[15418.34]]minded and you don't feel like learning
[[15421.82]]how to like actually build a Transformer
[[15424.82]]um
[[15427.88]]they you have there's less obvious how
[[15432.32]]you contribute directly but uh
[[15436.52]]I think mostly like
[[15440.42]]uh
[[15445.1]]helping correct the debate and correct
[[15449.6]]the tone of the discussion because this
[[15453.86]]like the super intelligent AI must kill
[[15457.88]]it might kill everyone thing gets
[[15460.82]]wrapped together with a bunch of other
[[15463.94]]concerns about AI that are real they're
[[15467.0]]their things but they're like normal
[[15469.58]]concerns like
[[15473.3]]will it just cause discrimination job
[[15477.8]]loss what's called job loss like I know
[[15481.1]]that let
[[15484.04]]that stuff's all like a thing but like
[[15488.24]]honestly on those things I sort of feel
[[15491.66]]about it the way I feel about most
[[15494.06]]regulation we're like
[[15497.36]]you know like it's a little early
[[15500.72]]probably there probably will be a good
[[15503.12]]regulation to write we don't know what
[[15505.34]]it looks like the area is evolving so
[[15508.1]]fast very hard to write good good
[[15511.94]]regulation
[[15517.04]]don't let that get confused
[[15521.36]]um job loss doesn't kill everyone yeah
[[15525.14]]so there's so there's there's AI ethics
[[15529.52]]and there's then there's AI not kill
[[15533.0]]everyone ism
[[15535.7]]and
[[15539.12]]the ad not kill everyone thing is like
[[15543.34]]we need the AI to not kill everyone
[[15548.68]]don't let people mush it together when
[[15554.02]]you see hear people conflating the two
[[15560.44]]correct the record uh because they're
[[15566.78]]just not the same idea
[[15570.62]]um and they're the same kind of problem
[[15573.8]]and they won't be solved with the same
[[15579.14]]kind of tools and uh
[[15586.04]]uh
[[15589.04]]the danger is that those two get sort of
[[15593.72]]wrapped together into some
[[15597.26]]thing again gets rejected by people who
[[15600.86]]just like well I don't who rejects the
[[15605.18]]safety AI safety aif ethics stuff that
[[15608.66]]they it's like well this doesn't really
[[15611.24]]make sense which I kind of agree with a
[[15614.06]]lot of the people who say like most that
[[15617.18]]stuff kind of doesn't make sense to me I
[[15622.76]]could see a theory maybe some of it um
[[15628.82]]we will throw out the the good part with
[[15633.2]]the bad and a lot of that other stuff is
[[15637.16]]true of almost any technology right yeah
[[15641.3]]that stuff is just general it's General
[[15645.38]]technological like and that's my thing
[[15648.74]]of why I think Silicon Valley in
[[15652.28]]particular has has struggled to talk
[[15655.58]]about this and I don't even know what my
[[15658.88]]fully formed opinions are on this stuff
[[15664.76]]but it's that for a long time Silicon
[[15670.7]]Valley has been accused of all the
[[15674.3]]negative externalities that are going to
[[15678.92]]come from uh whatever the technology is
[[15684.08]]that we've integrated around and so
[[15687.98]]everyone's very used to being defensive
[[15692.74]]about like oh job loss yeah
[[15698.98]]everyone's on the on the defense against
[[15704.66]]anything critical like sort of broadly
[[15709.58]]critical of new technologies because it
[[15713.6]]pattern matches to a bunch of people who
[[15717.26]]go around throwing up check throwing
[[15721.4]]chaff in the air attacking everything
[[15724.82]]all the time even when it doesn't really
[[15727.28]]make any sense
[[15730.22]]and so it's easy to slot it into that
[[15734.42]]the slot the whole thing into that thing
[[15738.32]]and just you know
[[15742.88]]throw it away and I just think like
[[15747.32]]uh
[[15752.06]]the uh there's there's a piece of that
[[15757.22]]that is different than the normal than
[[15761.06]]the norm it's hard Verity mood
[[15764.18]]affiliation drives most of our decision
[[15766.34]]making and it's hard to get people to
[[15768.92]]notice that
[[15772.46]]I have three more questions how are you
[[15777.08]]on uh time can we keep going time is it
[[15782.96]]we're almost at 30 so we're way overtime
[[15787.96]]um
[[15793.12]]what's my calendar here
[[15797.96]]um
[[15802.34]]oh I have to meet my friend uh let me
[[15806.9]]just text my friend real quick okay
[[15811.7]]um these won't be nearly as long as AI
[[15817.24]]ethics
[[15819.66]]all right all right
[[15822.54]]um
[[15825.24]]there's a graphic you tweeted out about
[[15828.78]]income that you said you keep handy for
[[15834.0]]dinner parties uh why do you keep that
[[15839.04]]graphic we'll show it on screen as we're
[[15842.28]]talking but why do you find that graphic
[[15845.1]]so interesting
[[15847.14]]um
[[15851.04]]it shows I think on a more optimistic
[[15855.54]]note than the one we were just on there
[[15859.02]]yeah yeah it it shows so first of all
[[15863.22]]the fundamentally what it shows is in
[[15866.46]]general people getting much richer
[[15869.04]]households getting much richer and
[[15871.56]]specific
[[15873.54]]um
[[15876.6]]house you know
[[15881.88]]the the almost all of it is the the bulk
[[15887.46]]of this curve moving down and that the
[[15892.26]]big spike on the right isn't a small
[[15895.86]]number of people getting much wealthier
[[15898.02]]it's
[[15901.14]]a lot more people making 200 that more
[[15906.12]]than 200 000 a year like eight percent
[[15910.38]]of the population and for people
[[15913.98]]listening it's like a distribution since
[[15919.62]]1970 or something of income and maybe a
[[15925.68]]Family household income in real terms
[[15930.6]]and in real terms and so it slides from
[[15935.16]]like a you know sliding kind of smiling
[[15940.02]]graph to being much more on the 200k
[[15945.3]]plus side of the axis and but the other
[[15949.08]]thing that happens is it goes from being
[[15953.52]]a pretty defined like bell curve to like
[[15958.2]]this weird like almost like exponential
[[15962.34]]decay shape like there's still a lump in
[[15966.18]]the bell curve area but like it's less
[[15969.24]]and less a bell curve and more and more
[[15974.64]]flat like an exponential decay curve of
[[15980.46]]people making every bucket people makes
[[15983.76]]there are slightly fewer people in the
[[15986.1]]bucket but actually there's about as
[[15989.04]]many people in forty thousand 30 to 40
[[15992.7]]as there are in 50 to 60 as there are 60
[[15997.2]]to 70 as they're already 70 to 80. it's
[[16001.16]]actually the main story is the
[[16004.22]]flattening
[[16007.7]]of the distribution
[[16011.18]]and what that flattening means is it
[[16015.26]]used to be there was a normal income
[[16021.38]]uh normal household income was 30 35 000
[[16027.2]]a year and if you're within and some
[[16030.44]]people made a little bit more and some
[[16033.92]]people made a little bit less but
[[16038.6]]for the most part everyone was in the
[[16042.74]]mode they had they made there was a real
[[16047.3]]modal income the there was a most common
[[16051.08]]income
[[16054.74]]and most people made relatively close
[[16059.6]]almost everyone made relatively close to
[[16064.1]]that that amount of money
[[16067.94]]and what has been happening and then you
[[16071.3]]had some number of very rich people and
[[16074.78]]like medium rich people but like the
[[16077.84]]bulk of society was in that thing and
[[16080.48]]what's been happening is
[[16083.78]]uh
[[16088.94]]there isn't really a norm anymore we've
[[16094.4]]destroyed the norm and instead there's
[[16098.24]]just
[[16102.08]]some people made a lot more money some
[[16106.34]]people made a lot a lot more money some
[[16109.58]]people made a medium amount more money
[[16112.7]]some people made a little more money
[[16118.04]]but like in general uh
[[16124.82]]everyone's do making like uh everyone's
[[16130.34]]making more but the the
[[16135.14]]there isn't a it's hard everyone at can
[[16138.98]]now look to the person the left and the
[[16141.68]]person on the right there's like lots of
[[16144.74]]people making a lot more money than me
[[16147.86]]and lots of people making a lot less
[[16151.28]]money than me for most people
[[16155.0]]and that feels bad it feels like
[[16158.54]]inequality it also is inequality
[[16162.56]]actually but but everyone's getting
[[16166.82]]richer which is good and yet somehow
[[16171.2]]it's this flattening that creates a
[[16177.92]]sense of like being left behind and
[[16184.22]]I don't quite know what to do about it
[[16187.94]]because it's a it's a very optimistic
[[16192.2]]story on the one hand of like
[[16197.42]]American households generally getting
[[16201.92]]much wealthier and many many more people
[[16206.18]]having access to more uh resources which
[[16210.2]]is good that's the good that we'd like
[[16212.96]]that
[[16216.02]]um there is a slight Spike at the very
[[16219.56]]bottom of people with almost nothing I
[[16222.5]]think that's that is that's also an
[[16224.84]]issue
[[16226.64]]um
[[16228.74]]and it's not to say there aren't any
[[16231.14]]issues in our society like you know
[[16234.32]]obviously Healthcare education
[[16240.32]]um housing all cost you much but
[[16246.8]]like the the real
[[16251.0]]uh
[[16254.54]]underlying thing that bothers people
[[16258.92]]that that on the other side of like this
[[16263.54]]this flattening out I'm not quite sure
[[16266.84]]how you
[[16269.84]]how do you how do you how do you fix
[[16273.08]]that without like making everyone really
[[16276.14]]poor there's an easy way to fix it make
[[16279.08]]everybody poor
[[16282.74]]go back everyone take it take a bunch of
[[16287.3]]money for everybody it's easy to break
[[16290.96]]things it's easy to make people more
[[16294.5]]poor um and so
[[16299.42]]I think a big part of what happens there
[[16304.64]]is as it's you get spread out more you
[[16309.68]]have the the housing in the middle
[[16314.18]]um the people in the middle can't afford
[[16317.66]]things that get bit if there's a good
[[16320.6]]that gets where there's a limited Supply
[[16324.62]]and it's getting bit up and you make
[[16329.72]]you're making more money on that
[[16335.36]]particular good you are screwed and that
[[16339.92]]sounds a lot like education and housing
[[16343.1]]to me um and so I think that's a that's
[[16346.46]]a big part of why it feels so bad for
[[16348.74]]people
[[16350.72]]um which is why I care so much about
[[16353.6]]getting more housing made making
[[16356.66]]education more available I think these
[[16360.92]]these things are very important
[[16366.32]]you recently turned 40 and you did a Tim
[[16371.42]]Urban ish layout of your life and time
[[16376.52]]spent doing that exercise was it on a
[[16380.96]]weekly basis yeah every week yeah every
[[16383.78]]week
[[16386.9]]did an internalization of turning 40 and
[[16390.8]]laying graphically out how you spent
[[16394.4]]your time did were there any takeaways
[[16398.6]]from from that that you
[[16402.62]]I mean I kind of I knew the story
[[16406.16]]already yeah um
[[16409.1]]it was just kind of cool to see it all
[[16411.2]]laid out
[[16414.2]]um and uh
[[16418.04]]I guess my biggest takeaway was man I
[[16422.24]]spent a long time in school yeah it's
[[16425.9]]been a really long time like maybe
[[16428.36]]longer than I needed to like maybe I
[[16431.06]]could have started working earlier in
[[16435.32]]retrospect yeah uh that was not that
[[16439.34]]many surprises it was fun though it's
[[16441.98]]like fun to encourage everyone to do it
[[16444.62]]it's fun to lay your life out like that
[[16448.04]]and take a look at it you live in San
[[16452.54]]Francisco are you optimistic about San
[[16456.8]]Francisco absolutely the city is uh
[[16460.88]]doing doing much better than it was
[[16464.36]]during covet Cove is very hard in San
[[16467.18]]Francisco I think
[[16469.22]]um
[[16471.74]]we have problems
[[16474.8]]um you know the fentanyl crisis is
[[16476.96]]really real people are dying in the
[[16480.08]]streets it's like not okay
[[16483.86]]um
[[16487.1]]but we also have a lot of really big
[[16489.92]]advantages
[[16492.98]]um and there's a lot of good happening
[[16498.74]]in the city too and I'm uh
[[16504.08]]I think I'm most encouraged by the
[[16506.96]]number of people I know who
[[16510.14]]uh have built their careers and their
[[16513.02]]lives here and who are committed to the
[[16515.42]]city and who are
[[16518.18]]not leaving and they're planning to do
[[16521.0]]the work to try to make San Francisco
[[16524.66]]better place where it's you know
[[16528.62]]the core things that everybody cares
[[16532.04]]about right like you shouldn't be people
[[16535.16]]who
[[16538.4]]don't have anywhere to live dying on the
[[16543.56]]streets uh there shouldn't be obvious
[[16549.32]]rampant crime people being victimized by
[[16554.96]]that uh left and right uh there
[[16559.82]]shouldn't be housing shouldn't be so
[[16563.6]]expensive that like you have to be rich
[[16567.38]]to have access to it
[[16570.14]]um
[[16572.48]]there should be better Transit options
[[16575.36]]for people um they don't they don't want
[[16579.32]]them stuck in traffic like the park we
[[16582.98]]have more and better Parks like I don't
[[16585.62]]know there's none of these things are
[[16588.92]]controversial and in fact I wouldn't
[[16592.58]]even say any of these things are
[[16596.84]]uh things that we want we don't
[[16601.28]]all we don't have wide agreement that we
[[16604.64]]should go do
[[16608.14]]um
[[16610.26]]it's a matter of I think that I pretty
[[16614.1]]strongly disagree with many of the
[[16617.7]]people who but what will cause the
[[16622.14]]outcome but I think the good news is
[[16625.44]]we're all aligned on wanting the same
[[16629.16]]things and so it's just a matter of
[[16634.08]]getting the right plan in place for the
[[16638.46]]right people executing it
[[16642.66]]um and these kinds of changes are not uh
[[16647.64]]startups are all about speed
[[16653.1]]um politics and government policy is all
[[16657.0]]about consistency
[[16659.58]]and so that's that's sort of where my
[[16663.66]]focus is just you know keep keep turning
[[16668.22]]the wheel last one before I let you go
[[16671.94]]what's what's a piece of conventional
[[16676.08]]Silicon Valley wisdom that you
[[16680.52]]wholeheartedly disagree with or think
[[16684.54]]people get wrong
[[16690.06]]the the most of the wholehearted wisdom
[[16696.96]]in Silicon Valley is 100 correct for
[[16701.58]]certain people in certain context and
[[16704.7]]100 wrong for other people in other
[[16708.18]]contexts and trying to come up with a
[[16711.78]]piece of advice that's always wrong is
[[16715.08]]like
[[16718.56]]pretty hard
[[16723.0]]um because like that's you know advice
[[16729.12]]is over generalization and so
[[16735.66]]it almost always is true in some context
[[16740.28]]um what about proportionally gets said
[[16746.22]]yeah a lot and like is is should be said
[[16753.12]]relatively is usually not right
[[16756.96]]um
[[16761.52]]oh I I know uh startups hire a players
[[16766.14]]startups should not be trying to hire
[[16768.42]]any players I mean you can be trying if
[[16771.24]]you want you're not you're lying to
[[16775.08]]yourself uh you don't know what an a
[[16779.22]]player looks like if you did they
[[16782.88]]wouldn't work for you
[[16785.88]]um you might be an a player because you
[[16789.36]]like the founding team like might be a
[[16793.74]]players potentially you hope you hope
[[16798.36]]you are that's your goal but like and
[[16802.98]]you might hire some a players because
[[16806.64]]you attract them and they like believe
[[16809.58]]in the mission I'm not saying you never
[[16812.04]]hire an a player but they think you're
[[16815.52]]gonna hire all a players I mean come on
[[16820.92]]no you're not that's just like a lie and
[[16825.98]]and
[[16830.78]]that's okay
[[16834.96]]and this idea that you can separate
[[16837.72]]people and sort of a players and B
[[16840.12]]players anyways I know what people mean
[[16842.34]]by it it's like you want to hire like
[[16844.92]]the most talented people in the entire
[[16847.8]]world but actually what you really want
[[16851.16]]to hire are talented people who will
[[16854.94]]work hard and believe in the mission and
[[16858.66]]who want to work for you
[[16862.86]]and like there are a lot of those people
[[16866.88]]and you should go hire them
[[16870.66]]um and
[[16875.1]]uh
[[16879.72]]and that that that idea is like a sort
[[16884.34]]of toxic Elite idea that like I think I
[[16889.38]]just think is ridiculous like that's you
[[16895.02]]can't do it and you shouldn't try
[[16899.64]]most of the time and then you have
[[16902.7]]companies
[[16906.0]]um that are on the very very Cutting
[[16910.26]]Edge of Technology where
[[16914.34]]you better hire pretty much all a
[[16918.3]]players you're gonna die and
[[16922.5]]you have to hire very slowly Renaissance
[[16925.86]]Technologies it's basically Renaissance
[[16929.7]]technology is a hedge fund that actually
[[16933.42]]hires only like you have to have
[[16936.6]]published multiple groundbreaking math
[[16940.62]]papers before they'll like they'll hire
[[16945.24]]you like in statistics like they're not
[[16949.14]]joking around they're actually hiring a
[[16951.9]]players it might be the most interesting
[[16954.78]]business in the world or at least on a
[[16958.5]]very short list yeah yeah and but like
[[16963.18]]you're not rentac yeah don't kick
[[16967.68]]yourself yeah yeah good well Emmett
[[16972.32]]thanks for doing this thank you everyone
