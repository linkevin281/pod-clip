[[3.13]]hi listeners welcome to no priers today
[[7.81]]we have Ivan Z co-founder and CEO of
[[12.45]]notion the Beloved productivity
[[16.69]]application for notes tasks and
[[21.25]]knowledge base they recently launched an
[[26.57]]AI Q&A interface as well as a calendar
[[31.25]]application we're super excited to have
[[35.57]]Ian thanks for being here again Ivan uh
[[40.17]]we are going to start with the hardest
[[44.65]]question which is what is notion Notions
[[48.77]]always pretty hard to Define because can
[[52.65]]do so many different things um but
[[56.41]]that's also our goal we want to give
[[60.25]]people one tool that they can do their
[[64.73]]most work with for personal user that
[[69.13]]means all your personal notes all the
[[73.37]]planning for a trip for for your wedding
[[77.45]]for business for Enterprise for company
[[82.17]]that means all your documents all your
[[87.81]]task all your issues calendaring
[[93.45]]knowledge basing in one tool um the
[[97.73]]reason we want to do that because just's
[[101.45]]just so much fragmentation in the market
[[105.89]]today we wish like it wouldn't be nice
[[111.17]]as one place to do your most work and
[[116.09]]the our approach here is rather than
[[120.69]]trying to cram all of use cases into one
[[126.05]]product uh what are the underlying
[[130.73]]software building blocks what are the
[[135.45]]Legos that power those use cases can we
[[141.05]]give users those Legos so they can be
[[145.73]]creative with software themselves they
[[150.37]]can create and Tinker their perfect
[[155.49]]workflow for their personal life or for
[[160.33]]their company and none of this is new by
[[165.21]]the way like people back in the
[[170.49]]80s even' 70s tried this kind of
[[175.61]]building blocks approach to software
[[179.57]]we're just trying to take a modern spin
[[184.69]]with cloud and with AI uh to what it's
[[191.13]]like to break the prison of application
[[196.73]]based software it's dramatic to think
[[201.41]]we've been living in a prison of SAS
[[206.69]]fragmentation the last two decades but I
[[213.45]]I do think it's actually um uh you know
[[219.65]]surprising to hear eight points of view
[[224.17]]that is so obvious which is like of
[[227.89]]course we want one tool where the data
[[232.01]]was interconnected why do you think
[[237.25]]people um why do you think more people
[[242.93]]don't try that to have unified tools and
[[247.17]]UniFi data
[[250.77]]underneath I think people try for
[[256.09]]different angles like even fairly
[[261.53]]recently there's this thing called NOCO
[[266.13]]right NOCO is like coming from this kind
[[272.17]]of like power user developer angle of
[[277.65]]wouldn't be nice everybody can modify
[[281.09]]this underlying software they use every
[[284.57]]day that's one angle that it wasn't
[[288.77]]coming from the angle of the the
[[292.77]]knowledge and data wants to be in one
[[297.25]]place right and language model sort of
[[302.21]]give another angle the underlying
[[306.45]]knowledge in the bending space wants to
[[310.89]]be one place wouldn't be nice in one
[[316.25]]place right and the macro is also coming
[[322.17]]from the uh the budget place wouldn't be
[[326.57]]nice rather than pay for five different
[[330.65]]vendors and all C based business just to
[[335.29]]pay one vendor and save some money so
[[338.81]]they have different angles from
[[344.45]]different times um I would say we are
[[351.81]]more come from this kind of computing
[[358.81]]and medium and literacy angle like you
[[364.69]]and me go through school to learn how to
[[370.05]]read and write know English and Chinese
[[375.49]]we spent years to do that we all know
[[380.69]]how to do that the world the same
[[387.13]]MacBook for most people are are very
[[392.69]]rich as I more like a machine to do
[[399.05]]typew writing or watching YouTube uh not
[[404.61]]much more beyond that it's not very
[[409.25]]creative right um wouldn't be more nice
[[414.49]]that more people can use their software
[[420.01]]more creatively right because there's a
[[425.21]]separation be between people who can
[[429.01]]make software and people who use
[[433.97]]software that's why sf's rent is so
[[438.93]]expensive because we're the modern day
[[443.05]]Detroit or Manchester right we're the
[[448.29]]factory of the world um Notions largely
[[454.13]]come from that angle which is the
[[459.45]]original angle we were inspired by early
[[463.73]]Computing Pioneer they thought about
[[467.29]]that angle right they thought about
[[471.29]]Computing could just be like literacy
[[475.81]]one day everybody can do it I guess they
[[481.93]]didn't expect AI might make that even
[[487.93]]give a really interesting twist to it
[[493.85]]because now language model AI can not
[[500.49]]only to create software but also do a
[[506.01]]lot of thinking working for you so the
[[511.81]]future is pretty interesting no so for
[[518.21]]someone who thinks on you know um span
[[523.97]]of like Decades of you know what should
[[529.49]]Computing look like and what were um
[[534.05]]what were the most ambitious plans for
[[538.65]]personal Computing you know uh three
[[544.29]]four decades ago like what are you most
[[549.41]]excited about seeing from AI broadly
[[554.89]]over the next decade I think 34 decad is
[[560.49]]bit too long if AGI happen that time
[[565.05]]like Computing might not be
[[569.77]]necessary for this
[[575.53]]decade I think a one sleeper category is
[[582.01]]the the drag thing embedding space the
[[586.93]]de case might be too long we're saying
[[590.53]]the next next year or two now the
[[594.37]]language model can understand what you
[[599.33]]put into a computer understanding so
[[604.89]]rather than you to the organization to
[[609.33]]make you retrieval retrieve the
[[613.29]]understanding more easily machine can do
[[617.33]]that better than anybody else can right
[[622.21]]so before that uh we use keyword-based
[[626.85]]search where you find your coworker who
[[631.49]]remember that that cue where does that
[[638.01]]information sit now just ask notion Ai
[[644.89]]and you get that in second so that's one
[[649.81]]I'm personally really excited about I
[[653.61]]think not enough people talk about it
[[658.13]]and of course the other one is like the
[[663.01]]agent the workflow side that that's has
[[667.41]]a lot of buzs already so that's
[[670.61]]interesting
[[675.17]]too you and Simon uh you said bet the
[[681.21]]company on AI and are you know have real
[[686.65]]conviction and as you are building out
[[691.89]]the team like um what does the talent
[[697.25]]look like you like have or need to make
[[702.41]]um notion and AI first company and I
[[706.09]]kind of argue you folks are one of the
[[709.41]]earliest adop of AI at scale as an
[[713.21]]application so part of the question in
[[716.37]]some sense is you built so many
[[719.25]]interesting things like what are the
[[722.21]]people that you now need to sort of
[[725.13]]build the next level stuff in addition
[[728.17]]to what you already have on the team in
[[731.85]]early days kind of just Bo Force slim is
[[735.85]]really good thing k a lot of thing and
[[739.77]]learned really quickly right I would say
[[744.21]]notion is a company where largely people
[[748.81]]interested in interface and design a lot
[[754.37]]of full stack front then heavy folks and
[[760.53]]back and people who scale we have
[[766.17]]somewhat a small team of search but we
[[771.57]]don't have too too many ml folks almost
[[777.21]]nothing and in at least my learning our
[[781.85]]learning in the past year or so building
[[787.53]]for AI is okay you m Mo folks
[[794.69]]are important it's kind of like you no
[[800.81]]longer do a this deterministic thing
[[805.41]]that you can see how it works it's
[[808.73]]almost like a I don't bake but feels
[[812.49]]like a baking right you have to like do
[[816.61]]something get the thing ingredients
[[820.93]]ready run through rinse press the button
[[824.93]]and wait for a while and see does it
[[828.25]]come up it's a different way different
[[831.77]]sense of patience and different type of
[[836.45]]personality to do that well a lot of
[[841.09]]massaging a lot of
[[844.93]]preparing my friends call that
[[848.77]]probalistic software engineering kind of
[[852.37]]like I think it's it's morphed into this
[[856.45]]sort of stochastic world or at least
[[861.61]]partially stochastic yeah so one is like
[[866.37]]maybe gardening feels like that way I
[[871.89]]don't Garden either uh so that's
[[878.29]]category people are to to me is pretty
[[883.25]]necessary the other category is like
[[888.33]]people who are curious and learn really
[[895.45]]fast right it's like okay um like the
[[902.41]]group of promp like language prompt
[[906.85]]engineer language model sort of make
[[911.93]]everybody like a a real time machine
[[917.53]]learn learning engineer you just prompt
[[921.89]]write then you can get your stuff right
[[925.29]]and there's a lot of trick and
[[929.65]]techniques uh um and how does that plug
[[936.17]]into user interface uh I think this
[[941.45]]category of people call AI engineer or
[[945.53]]something there's an terminology form
[[949.93]]they tend to be pretty young they tend
[[954.21]]to be like we have someone like under
[[959.93]]drinking age working ocean uh they they
[[965.61]]fit into that bucket and I think both
[[970.61]]seems to work quite well um we don't
[[975.37]]have too many researchers and notion
[[981.33]]that's another one I think uh um will be
[[987.85]]important but we're fundamentally sit in
[[992.25]]the application layer so it's more about
[[997.29]]apply side of things more manipulating
[[1002.09]]the models and making sure you can scale
[[1006.25]]them to like user outcomes and things
[[1011.25]]about that and another part is like the
[[1015.97]]scaling part right how do you scale to
[[1020.65]]like tens of millions 100 million users
[[1025.57]]it's bit it's a problem on its own to
[[1029.89]]it's beyond just a demo on Twitter right
[[1036.49]]It's Tricky no yeah so you have often
[[1044.49]]said that uh notion is less a
[[1050.37]]productivity company than an application
[[1054.69]]Building Company how do you think about
[[1058.57]]the initial use case and like how what
[[1062.09]]makes you believe people want to build
[[1065.09]]more application I don't think people
[[1069.21]]want to build more applications what got
[[1073.77]]me started in notion got I started in
[[1079.41]]notion it's um last year college I read
[[1085.37]]a paper by uh one of the Computing
[[1091.01]]Pioneers Douglas angelar and he talked
[[1096.53]]about his papers name augmenting human
[[1100.93]]intellect so every day we use software
[[1104.97]]today is very much like application when
[[1109.17]]you go into one application do one thing
[[1113.41]]but for that generation of computing
[[1118.33]]people in the 60 70 80s computers are a
[[1122.61]]lot more software are a lot more
[[1126.09]]malleable you can actually Tinker it
[[1131.13]]modify right small talk you can go into
[[1135.49]]and change the how operating system work
[[1140.81]]on the Fly um that really inspired me
[[1147.25]]like today people software are so rigid
[[1152.29]]can we create a new breed of software
[[1157.25]]that people can modify can and can
[[1162.53]]change and customize and bring back some
[[1167.81]]original esos of those early Computing
[[1173.97]]Pioneers that's why we started notion um
[[1180.09]]the hard lesson for us is like like you
[[1183.89]]mentioned most people don't want to
[[1187.01]]create software they don't wake up said
[[1190.89]]hey I want to create my perfect project
[[1194.53]]management tool my project perfect
[[1198.33]]knowledge base they boss ask for
[[1201.93]]something they just have to get the work
[[1207.57]]done right um so the in some sense our
[[1214.09]]learning and pivot is instead of giving
[[1220.25]]people those um software building tool
[[1225.77]]we have to package the software building
[[1229.65]]blocks together as ready to use
[[1235.21]]templates as ready to use use cases then
[[1240.53]]people can adopt really quickly so you
[[1244.29]]were one of the earliest adopters of AI
[[1249.17]]in terms of appc with any real scale and
[[1253.65]]I think it's impressive how quickly noan
[[1257.29]]ended up starting to work in this area
[[1261.01]]how do you think about how that impacts
[[1264.17]]different aspects of what you built and
[[1267.81]]what you're building going forward and
[[1271.13]]how does that impact that vision of
[[1275.01]]saying okay we have this um this
[[1279.09]]effective platform that allows people to
[[1283.57]]both interact with uh documents or core
[[1288.41]]use cases in simple ways add things like
[[1291.53]]calendar but then also go in very
[[1294.09]]interesting directions in terms of both
[[1296.77]]a set of applications and templates they
[[1300.05]]can use yeah I think we're lucky like I
[[1303.53]]mentioned we're not trying to build
[[1306.97]]specific use cases right we're trying to
[[1311.17]]build a Lego bricks that power those use
[[1316.65]]cases um what are those Lego bricks text
[[1322.25]]editing is a one fundamental Lego bricks
[[1327.21]]most software have that piece relational
[[1332.17]]database a table is one fundamental Lego
[[1336.77]]bricks right um different form of
[[1341.13]]permission commenting so we've been
[[1345.09]]spent five plus years building those
[[1349.69]]Lego bricks and feels like boom AI just
[[1354.33]]jumps in almost like a brand new car
[[1358.25]]engine and can power those Lego braks in
[[1363.25]]brand new ways uh so feels very lucky in
[[1368.17]]that way and that because we've been
[[1372.09]]building those Lego bricks and refining
[[1376.57]]those allow us to ship features uh
[[1381.69]]pluging with AI really quickly we one of
[[1387.13]]the earlier one to launch AI writing for
[[1391.89]]productivity software at scale because
[[1396.05]]we've been spent years building a text
[[1402.61]]editor uh we can do uh AI power database
[[1408.53]]table features really quickly because
[[1411.69]]we've been building a relational
[[1415.21]]databases um we've been building a
[[1418.93]]knowledge base for a long time so we
[[1422.93]]launch AI Q&A really quickly fairly
[[1428.41]]quickly uh the rack system on top of oce
[[1433.89]]because we have those Lego breaks uh so
[[1438.65]]in some sense kind of like at just right
[[1443.29]]moment right time for us right how did
[[1448.69]]you um begin to like resource and
[[1453.37]]prioritize this effort because you're
[[1456.85]]like ah magic we have this engine it
[[1461.65]]applies for our Lego bricks um and then
[[1466.17]]he started shipping pretty quickly but I
[[1469.25]]think there are a lot of organizations
[[1471.81]]right now trying to figure out what to
[[1475.97]]do with AI and so you know in terms of
[[1481.33]]like designing the features prioritizing
[[1485.09]]that effort versus everything you're
[[1488.29]]already doing and a rapidly growing
[[1494.65]]software company yeah I think I had the
[[1501.89]]conviction my co-founder Simon actually
[[1507.77]]they all had the conviction um funny
[[1512.69]]because we all live in the mission right
[[1516.73]]and openi initially still is in the
[[1521.21]]mission and uh some of my friends
[[1525.41]]especially Simon's friends work at open
[[1529.13]]remember we go to their office they
[[1532.61]]during the DOTA days they like what is
[[1536.69]]this company doing kind of interesting
[[1542.01]]and Simon and some people in notion saw
[[1547.09]]early that most gpts like what is this
[[1552.25]]thing spin out text sometimes gibberish
[[1557.33]]sometimes useful
[[1562.29]]um I personally I have to admit I slept
[[1569.37]]on it on on gpt3 even saw gpt3 feels
[[1576.25]]like what is this thing useful for it's
[[1581.21]]like yes for marketing for Content
[[1585.49]]writing Crea first draft didn't really
[[1591.65]]click for me um personally for me was uh
[[1597.37]]fortunate enough to start early preview
[[1602.33]]gbd4 and that's like oh wow this thing
[[1607.01]]can think
[[1611.73]]it can reason it can know how to do
[[1617.29]]things has this little bit workflow
[[1622.57]]power to it that's a big a heart for me
[[1627.21]]and like it just give me it personally
[[1630.77]]give me so much conviction like this is
[[1634.81]]going to change everything if you think
[[1639.33]]about what knowledge work is in right
[[1645.37]]why do we use software fundamentally SAS
[[1652.37]]software is all we all in the same
[[1658.97]]information people paper pushing
[[1664.41]]activity right it's like a piece of
[[1669.33]]paper coming in front of you a
[[1674.89]]human like change a couple bits push to
[[1680.05]]another human Lang model can do some
[[1685.57]]form of this now so uh so that just like
[[1690.17]]give me the conviction like this going
[[1693.61]]to completely change everything we do
[[1699.49]]with a computer and after that we sort
[[1705.89]]of just bet the company on it uh like
[[1710.21]]we're lucky enough to have those Lego
[[1713.77]]breaks and then what come which legal
[[1717.89]]breaks can works well with AI which
[[1722.45]]doesn't we're trying to figure that out
[[1727.21]]who inside a company are good with this
[[1731.77]]technology we have search but it's not
[[1736.17]]like we don't have a lot of ml folks so
[[1741.81]]need to hire more ml folks need to get
[[1747.13]]people inside a company to have similar
[[1750.69]]convictions so we can move in the same
[[1754.05]]direction it's quite interesting it's
[[1757.21]]kind of
[[1761.49]]like so must dinosaur feels like when
[[1766.25]]Astro hit the earth and like what do
[[1769.69]]they do there yeah yeah there's a lot of
[[1772.93]]change coming for sure it's a lot of
[[1776.05]]change yeah what do you think is missing
[[1779.13]]from the capability set because to your
[[1783.45]]point I think a lot of people weren't
[[1787.97]]really thinking about AI too much until
[[1792.09]]chat GPT and gp4 came out and there was
[[1795.77]]a period of time where three and then
[[1798.49]]3.5 and you started to see the
[[1801.81]]capabilities incrementing up and
[[1805.33]]entirely new businesses are suddenly
[[1809.01]]able enabled with each sort of step with
[[1814.17]]the next GPT level model you know GPT 5
[[1818.65]]or de your point rag adds a lot of
[[1821.85]]capabilities what are the biggest
[[1825.81]]missing gaps for you to take full
[[1829.37]]advantage of this technology is it
[[1834.93]]future reasoning is it better uh
[[1840.93]]thinking and knowledge like what's the
[[1845.33]]yeah I think all about that above to me
[[1849.01]]it feels
[[1852.93]]like technology is fun we're in the tech
[[1857.65]]business technology is fundamentally
[[1862.81]]about tradeoffs right it's like the
[[1868.37]]plastic can do things that wood cannot
[[1872.85]]do and we discover plastic and then we
[[1876.61]]figure out new things we can bottle
[[1879.85]]water like this before you cannot bottle
[[1884.97]]water with a wood table right so um all
[[1890.25]]of a sudden we have this thing called
[[1893.69]]language model you have a new
[[1897.77]]characteristic that deterministic
[[1904.05]]software cannot do in the past and and
[[1910.53]]we don't really know how it's made fully
[[1915.21]]so every month every week if you're on
[[1919.17]]Twitter people discover new techniques
[[1924.93]]to get more out of this and for
[[1931.77]]companies entrepreneurs they're also
[[1936.89]]making tra off discover what how the
[[1941.61]]market react to this capabilities of
[[1946.93]]this new W this new language model and
[[1951.61]]so it's a constant evolutional cycle
[[1956.25]]happening really really fast right now
[[1960.73]]right
[[1966.33]]um I think if with that mindset uh what
[[1972.97]]are the dimensions um on the technical
[[1978.69]]side on the technology side itself yes
[[1984.25]]the model gets larger context Windows
[[1990.41]]more reasoning better speed smaller
[[1996.53]]footprint um those are all great like
[[2000.33]]like for
[[2004.45]]notion uh to power the work force I
[[2009.41]]would really need like we learn like gp4
[[2014.61]]is smart a cloud to a Smart we need that
[[2019.65]]intelligent to do reasoning or for a
[[2024.57]]tech summarization cheap fasts better
[[2030.93]]right that's the technology side and in
[[2036.33]]my opinion there's so much about human
[[2042.09]]behavior as well just like inertia in in
[[2048.69]]our personal Behavior companies risk
[[2055.41]]tolerance and that's slowly evolving as
[[2062.33]]well right like like what Steve Jobs
[[2066.97]]always was talk about you cannot make
[[2070.49]]something too new you have to be largely
[[2074.45]]the same and change one thing and two
[[2079.37]]thing right virtual Appo the off white
[[2084.93]]guys is like 3% difference just push the
[[2089.81]]boundary so people can accept it but
[[2094.45]]still also new right to me it feels like
[[2099.13]]language model power application are
[[2103.29]]kind of in the same pH if it's too
[[2107.17]]different people like what do they do
[[2112.01]]with it right such alien Behavior it has
[[2116.93]]to rag is pretty nice because the larg
[[2122.01]]the existing Behavior but better output
[[2127.65]]right can you describe the um the Q&A
[[2132.45]]product for people who have an
[[2137.49]]experience right essentially everything
[[2141.77]]you put in
[[2145.85]]notion notion help you
[[2150.53]]remember right and this is not just
[[2154.37]]apply to notion pretty apply to most
[[2158.81]]rack systems like why do we use computer
[[2162.69]]when you to store things I need to
[[2166.81]]recall things before language model and
[[2171.49]]rack the recall largely happen based on
[[2175.77]]keywords right you the keyword has to be
[[2180.77]]precise or there's some lexical Tech
[[2187.85]]tricks you can like recall easily um uh
[[2194.53]]imprecisely what rack happens language
[[2199.09]]model can actually understand what
[[2203.53]]you're put into there so you no longer
[[2207.77]]need to organize your information in
[[2212.49]]notion whatever you throw in there you
[[2217.93]]can find it later what that means is for
[[2223.85]]a person or for a company for a team you
[[2229.97]]can have perfect memory and not only
[[2234.69]]have Perfect Memory the the right piece
[[2238.77]]of information if we design our software
[[2242.53]]right can push to the right person at
[[2246.37]]the right time right that's probably
[[2251.85]]more than 50% knowledge work right we're
[[2257.33]]still perfecting the system I think
[[2261.49]]we're one of the first on the market
[[2265.97]]that apply a skill we still have a some
[[2270.13]]somewhat a waiting list because it's
[[2273.77]]hard to do this at scale still um but
[[2278.69]]for a company for a team before search
[[2283.25]]one of a weaker point but with rack you
[[2287.13]]completely change that I changed how I
[[2291.17]]use notion I can just ask a question to
[[2296.49]]notion like um how large when I removing
[[2303.05]]out of the SF office to a new office and
[[2308.65]]someone in the company wrote in some
[[2313.05]]documents I don't have to Ping five
[[2316.49]]different three different people to find
[[2319.81]]the answers if it's in notion we'll find
[[2326.45]]it for me right um everyday Engineers
[[2333.89]]designers operation people just keep
[[2338.85]]asking each other on slack or in email
[[2343.01]]such a question each question is 10
[[2347.41]]minutes writing the answers 20 minutes
[[2351.89]]to find answers and there's a delay in
[[2357.05]]the Middle with notion Q&A you can
[[2362.85]]completely cut that right into in
[[2367.37]]seconds we're just at the beginning of
[[2371.25]]what rack can do for work it's pretty
[[2375.33]]amazing I feel like Rag and edings are
[[2380.21]]very under discussed or underappreciated
[[2384.49]]in some sense relative to the impact
[[2387.21]]they really seem to be having or
[[2390.25]]starting to have and I think notion um
[[2393.93]]Q&A is a great example of that I guess
[[2397.25]]the other thing that you folks just
[[2400.81]]launched is calendaring and if you can't
[[2404.57]]talk about it or if there's nothing to
[[2408.41]]talk about that's fine too but um I feel
[[2411.77]]like one of the really interesting
[[2413.93]]things that people are talking
[[2416.69]]increasingly about is agents and sort of
[[2419.77]]the agentic world and there's a lot of
[[2422.53]]capabilities missing to really make
[[2426.41]]those valuable but in the can context of
[[2430.49]]a calendaring application you could
[[2433.85]]think of all sorts of ways that having
[[2438.49]]AI act on your behalf or help understand
[[2443.53]]things can be incredibly valuable and so
[[2446.93]]I curious how you think about the
[[2450.21]]application of AI relative to calendar
[[2454.57]]versus you know some of the core um
[[2458.29]]information related things that you just
[[2462.29]]talked about maybe we can group AI stuff
[[2466.69]]into like at least in my mental model
[[2471.05]]it's the rack the knowledge information
[[2477.09]]retrieval is one bucket knowledge bucket
[[2482.69]]then there is this workflow bucket right
[[2488.97]]use the word agent uh um that's in that
[[2497.05]]bucket CER somewhat in that bucket um
[[2503.17]]why do we need to meet why do we need
[[2506.85]]Canada because we need to meet and we
[[2509.85]]need to schedule time we need to figure
[[2513.45]]out exchange some kind of bits between
[[2518.45]]my brain to your brain right um can that
[[2523.49]]bit can that exchange be done by a
[[2528.85]]language model maybe and can the meeting
[[2534.09]]time be done by scheduling be done
[[2539.21]]that's like a baby step right um and
[[2544.21]]most things we do has this kind of time
[[2548.73]]Dimension to it uh can language model
[[2553.65]]help us shuffling our schedule yeah it
[[2557.01]]feels like there's also the information
[[2559.73]]retrieval piece of it because you know
[[2563.37]]if my calendar autop populated
[[2566.61]]everything I need to know about the
[[2569.45]]meeting or the people attending or other
[[2573.13]]things that's incredibly valuable as a
[[2576.85]]user of a calendar and so I just feel
[[2579.53]]like there's a lot of these things that
[[2581.89]]kind of tieen together both in terms of
[[2585.09]]the coordination which you mentioned and
[[2588.25]]the workflow and then separate from that
[[2591.81]]there's just what do I know about this
[[2596.09]]the calendar part it's the simpler part
[[2600.01]]of the workflow like the holy grills
[[2604.25]]kind of like can just the agents robots
[[2608.97]]do all our knowledge work for us right
[[2612.89]]it's a really interesting framing that I
[[2616.17]]didn't have before of a bunch of the
[[2619.57]]work you're doing at notion actually
[[2624.33]]eating into like communication
[[2629.09]]right it's it's sort of obvious in
[[2632.49]]retrospect but like if you look at what
[[2636.09]]you describe like like am I really going
[[2639.61]]to slack back and forth about this thing
[[2643.37]]about you know when we're moving if I
[[2648.49]]can just know I'm in oce help me know or
[[2654.25]]with calendaring like you know the most
[[2658.33]]intelligent version of it is like well
[[2661.05]]do I need to have that meeting or can
[[2664.25]]you tell me what I was going to tell me
[[2667.37]]I know like why do you need to
[[2671.65]]communicate because there's something
[[2676.65]]the work cannot be done asynchronously
[[2680.45]]or by the software itself right then
[[2684.89]]that's why you talk uh
[[2689.69]]yeah it's kind of interesting maybe it's
[[2693.57]]interesting question like are we kind to
[[2697.73]]communicate more or less with language
[[2703.25]]model I probably feel it's probably less
[[2710.17]]uh uh the agent side essentially bet on
[[2715.77]]language model that's the communication
[[2718.97]]one question I have for you just going
[[2723.45]]back to like the implication of rag and
[[2728.17]]like you can be my brain and do my
[[2732.53]]Organization for me um like what if my
[[2737.13]]brain is really disorganized like do you
[[2741.69]]do you think that uh this changes the
[[2747.65]]amount of work people should do in
[[2755.09]]systems like notion at input right like
[[2761.33]]you know should I be designing my
[[2765.49]]knowledge base in the same structured
[[2769.97]]way or can of just dump it all in stream
[[2774.45]]of Consciousness in theut I think
[[2779.77]]organization might be we might be moving
[[2785.85]]away from the organizational world world
[[2790.33]]why do you need to organize because you
[[2792.77]]can
[[2796.45]]retrieve why do you have index like
[[2802.09]]index initially are file cabinets and
[[2806.65]]little IND are sitting on top of so you
[[2810.69]]can find things quickly right and they
[[2814.37]]index based on
[[2820.29]]certain uh names or certain Dimensions
[[2827.13]]but edding and rag sort you just you
[[2832.21]]have in semantically connection of all
[[2837.69]]the thing you throw into this file bag
[[2842.05]]and you can find bring it out however
[[2846.37]]you like so I think we might be moving
[[2852.53]]past the need for organization uh that's
[[2857.85]]really liberating that means on my phone
[[2861.53]]imagine this experience I'll have a new
[[2865.45]]idea I see a whiteboard behind me I just
[[2869.45]]take a picture or write something dump
[[2873.97]]it and notion going to organize for you
[[2878.65]]right so that's then that's become my
[[2882.77]]perfect memory to start later could be
[[2887.05]]my perfect assistant to help me do
[[2891.25]]something with this knowledge and that's
[[2896.37]]the vision we're moving towards right
[[2903.69]]that's super exciting to me so you are
[[2910.73]]um this is a question from h m foral
[[2915.25]]you've been long time friends with you
[[2918.49]]know you are a student of History you
[[2922.09]]mentioned duck angelart earlier I know
[[2925.53]]um you think about you know the
[[2929.45]]transition in terms of like Alan K and
[[2933.53]]what he did in terms of simplifying any
[[2937.09]]of those concepts for like a broader
[[2941.53]]audience around Computing Vernon's
[[2946.45]]question was what lessons in history do
[[2952.33]]you take that um inform your point of
[[2957.69]]view of like how to treat AI strategy
[[2962.29]]with notion now like from a prior
[[2968.37]]revolution in Computing you know how
[[2975.01]]does it help you decide what to
[[2981.81]]do a lot is intuition I think understand
[[2988.01]]understand history give you a sense of
[[2992.77]]History doesn't repeat itself but Rhymes
[[2999.57]]so like okay which phase are we in um I
[[3005.53]]personally think we're sort of in this
[[3011.09]]kind of bundling phase like um um who
[[3017.25]]said this like there's only two way to
[[3022.09]]do business bundling un bundling right
[[3028.17]]and uh actually the during the breakouts
[[3035.93]]reading a uh Chinese novel uh Romance of
[[3042.69]]three kingdoms and the opening sentence
[[3048.37]]of for that it's uh the Empire long
[[3054.97]]divided must unite long United must
[[3060.49]]divide that's has always been business
[[3066.73]]is the same way too right um we're in
[[3074.13]]the bundling phase I would say the stas
[[3079.61]]it's sort of this unboundly
[[3084.09]]fragmentation phase if we Trace back to
[[3090.93]]SAS why is SAS happening in the late 2
[[3097.81]]mid 2000s before that everything's
[[3102.41]]running on Microsoft that was a bundling
[[3107.21]]phase early days at PC there's so many
[[3112.33]]different applications the first version
[[3117.09]]of the the World Star World perfect
[[3121.85]]different text editors dbas different
[[3126.25]]database software the funny fact of
[[3130.97]]dbase is like they start with dbas 2
[[3136.21]]because there's so many company go bus
[[3140.29]]that it sounds like if they start with
[[3143.85]]dbas 2 people has more credibility it
[[3147.65]]feels like this this product has been
[[3152.21]]around for a while so that's the 80s
[[3157.85]]'90s was this kind of bundling phase
[[3162.69]]because Microsoft has OS layer on the
[[3166.45]]line yeah
[[3171.17]]and the sad is because the web becomes
[[3176.61]]good enough to run software right then
[[3181.13]]so then we have this un bundling phase a
[[3185.85]]fragmentation phase and then with the
[[3190.97]]the last 10 15 years it easy really the
[[3195.09]]money is cheap easy to create company
[[3198.93]]there's there's so
[[3203.69]]much too much now feels like there's
[[3208.85]]like information so fragmented and now
[[3213.45]]the new technology happening is AI
[[3218.37]]language model and if you build more
[[3223.17]]with it or just think more with it
[[3226.73]]language model wants information to be
[[3231.77]]one place wants the end points to be
[[3237.73]]connected so it's easier to is it hard
[[3242.25]]enough to at current version of language
[[3245.77]]model do do what you want but imagine
[[3248.93]]talk with different endpoint that's even
[[3252.41]]harder right
[[3257.53]]so and so we're in the bundling phase
[[3262.29]]because the macro but we're also in the
[[3266.05]]bundling phase because language model I
[[3270.37]]believe wants the things to be together
[[3273.65]]think makes sense I also feel like we're
[[3276.17]]in the bundling phase because the nature
[[3278.61]]of how Founders think about their
[[3282.09]]businesses shifted how so um I think
[[3286.65]]that uh it's interesting because I
[[3290.45]]remember I don't know 10 years ago I
[[3293.41]]used to argue with people about oh you
[[3296.77]]should really buy other companies or
[[3300.29]]integrate or sort of pull all these
[[3303.17]]things together and in consumer that
[[3306.05]]actually happened right like Facebook
[[3309.81]]bought Instagram and WhatsApp and other
[[3313.29]]things and they effectively created like
[[3315.81]]a bundle of social products that they
[[3318.85]]could cross use in different ways for
[[3322.77]]distribution or other things but I feel
[[3326.61]]like what happened is we had a series of
[[3329.73]]Highly technical Founders because we
[[3333.33]]shifted in the Facebook era from Cheryl
[[3338.45]]becoming CEO to coo and you went from
[[3343.97]]business Centric uh CEO in the 90s in
[[3347.93]]some cases although there's people like
[[3351.01]]Bill Gates who learned and adopted as
[[3354.45]]technologist to very technology and
[[3358.09]]product Riven Founders who often thought
[[3361.45]]no matter what product I build it always
[[3365.89]]has to be better and so I I can't just
[[3370.85]]think of distribution as my wedge I need
[[3374.09]]to think of every product as being
[[3376.53]]Superior and so I'm not going to build
[[3380.45]]certain things and now I feel like
[[3384.53]]people are both building great products
[[3387.17]]as well as bundling them but also
[[3389.57]]they're much more aggressive about
[[3393.01]]saying it can be 80% is good it could be
[[3396.77]]50% is good but I'm going to have a
[[3400.49]]bundle and that's HubSpot and that's
[[3405.05]]Rippling and they have very high quality
[[3408.77]]to their products it's just they realize
[[3411.45]]they don't need every single edge case
[[3414.41]]and every feature as long as they're
[[3418.61]]able to cross sell yeah I think the YC
[[3422.97]]school's philosophy of build one thing
[[3426.81]]use internet to find the
[[3431.93]]distribution that was I think overlap
[[3437.01]]quite a bit with the rise of internet
[[3441.81]]right and and feels like there's a value
[[3446.17]]to create on the other dimension which
[[3449.85]]is like you mentioned it doesn't have to
[[3454.69]]be as good 90% that's good but because
[[3459.17]]the Synergy of things just make a lot
[[3463.81]]easier a lot cheaper less tabs you open
[[3468.29]]your browser yeah it's all integrated
[[3472.21]]you have the information flow or or the
[[3476.17]]system of record for whatever thing that
[[3479.37]]you're dealing with yeah I think a lot
[[3483.93]]of people also just um perhaps lack that
[[3489.33]]uh sort of historical context right if
[[3494.57]]you look at the strategy of company is
[[3500.77]]like horrible right it was very much for
[[3506.85]]a decade and a half like a dominant at
[[3511.65]]least commercially attitude of like okay
[[3515.01]]we're going to buy the second best
[[3517.89]]product in this additional software
[[3521.65]]category we want to be in and then sell
[[3526.21]]the heck out of it worked great right
[[3530.25]]actually because um was very hard for
[[3533.41]]customers to deploy these things or
[[3536.17]]there're just advantages to everything
[[3539.17]]being attached to a single database at
[[3543.13]]some point and I I do think there is
[[3547.49]]some analogy to as you said language
[[3551.17]]models because having things in the same
[[3555.25]]edting space is very useful very useful
[[3559.37]]yeah I think there's bundling of
[[3564.05]]distribution and bundling of information
[[3568.57]]the what you're describing to me is more
[[3572.01]]of Microsoft more like bundling of
[[3576.85]]distribution langu wants the bundling of
[[3582.85]]data bundling information so I remember
[[3589.41]]hearing from Dylan at figma early on
[[3596.21]]that there was um one crazy user who was
[[3601.65]]in the product like 14 hours a day it
[[3606.29]]was you um early on in the uh notion
[[3611.29]]Journey um being really design obsessed
[[3615.65]]I think the company has a reputation for
[[3619.57]]that do you think of notion as like a
[[3624.09]]design Centric company and um is it
[[3629.41]]important how do you scale
[[3635.09]]it I think depends on what you mean by
[[3641.01]]design design is to us at least to me
[[3646.53]]it's less about how it looks is how the
[[3651.85]]system plug together right and then in
[[3656.41]]that case the trade off you make do you
[[3659.65]]centralize that thing or do you
[[3664.61]]decentralize that thing um certain
[[3669.93]]company work well or certain business of
[[3674.09]]product work well being decentralized
[[3678.33]]like operation heavy company could work
[[3682.45]]that way and notion like I mentioned
[[3686.25]]we're sort of in the bundling business
[[3689.69]]our value provided having this one
[[3693.97]]information space one works space for
[[3698.13]]people do all different kind of things
[[3702.21]]so things need to be work well together
[[3706.09]]it's almost building notion it feels
[[3709.41]]like building an operating system
[[3713.81]]building a programming language right
[[3719.65]]you don't you don't you don't Farm out
[[3725.41]]to like 50 people to design a
[[3729.17]]programming language you programming
[[3732.61]]language are done by one person so that
[[3736.77]]means the design here is very much
[[3741.29]]centralized energy so kind of like apple
[[3746.85]]how they build OS integrated with their
[[3752.73]]hardware and right like what is the
[[3757.89]]Apple for software doesn't quite exist
[[3762.73]]today right it truly doesn't quite
[[3767.77]]exist so that's what I'm interested in
[[3772.53]]what we're interested in so in that case
[[3777.21]]means to build a good product a good
[[3781.97]]customer user experience we need to
[[3786.69]]think things more horizontally more
[[3791.41]]holistically that means the decision-
[[3795.77]]making tend to be centralized in or
[[3800.37]]design team or like tend to be
[[3806.41]]centralized right so um less like more
[[3812.25]]so more Apple like less Amazon like it's
[[3815.97]]funny cuz when I first met you it was
[[3819.29]]just you starting notion and it before
[[3823.09]]you brought on Simon and and you talked
[[3826.69]]about things that way even then and I
[[3830.29]]felt that one of the reasons I was lucky
[[3834.09]]enough to invest or you know I I came on
[[3838.41]]board was because you had such a
[[3842.45]]cohesive view of how you wanted to build
[[3846.61]]software and you had such a cohesive
[[3851.61]]design aesthetic and it was your mock
[[3855.65]]but it was also how you were dressed and
[[3858.73]]how that reflected into the product I
[[3862.97]]felt like it was extremely striking you
[[3867.29]]know like you're one of a very small
[[3870.09]]number of people I've ever seen where
[[3872.53]]that design aesthetic has just kind of
[[3875.73]]permeated everything in a very cohesive
[[3879.77]]way and so that's one of the things that
[[3883.13]]got me excited at the time I was like
[[3888.81]]wow this is capturing a uh aesthetic
[[3894.65]]that could be an incredible product
[[3897.25]]platform but you also talked about
[[3900.09]]things even then I remember in terms of
[[3904.05]]like okay what's the what's the cohesive
[[3907.89]]Apple like thing that you can do for
[[3912.45]]software things so I think it's kind of
[[3917.13]]amazing to see that consistent thread so
[[3919.69]]I was just stricken while you were
[[3922.57]]talking you know by that yeah thank you
[[3926.89]]yeah like I study cognitive system
[[3931.09]]cognitive science which is kind of just
[[3935.17]]like a degree for everything in some
[[3939.25]]sense it's like a little bit philosophy
[[3944.09]]a little bit l State computer science I
[[3949.97]]learned how to Cod when I was a kid and
[[3956.41]]I did a lot of Art and also in school so
[[3962.57]]like try not to like there's so many
[[3966.49]]things you can steal from all of
[[3970.29]]different places right and it's like the
[[3975.85]]Bund are sort of man-made
[[3981.81]]and in notion was most our designer can
[[3987.49]]call majority of 80% of our designer can
[[3992.41]]call because the moment you can as a
[[3996.41]]designer or as engineer you can Cod or
[[3999.69]]you can design you can make really
[[4003.05]]interesting tradeoffs right at the end
[[4007.09]]of the day Technologies at least in my
[[4010.93]]opinion is about trade-offs what kind of
[[4017.09]]trade-off you can make that unlock new
[[4025.01]]user behaviors that's valuable but if
[[4031.01]]you can do more things you can more make
[[4034.81]]more interest and trade off the other
[[4038.45]]people cannot make as a designer if you
[[4042.65]]can code you know how to change your
[[4046.09]]design to make easier to build as
[[4049.57]]engineer if you can design you can like
[[4053.13]]do the same thing almost like squeeze
[[4056.81]]the air bubble to whichever direction is
[[4061.85]]easier to squeeze right um
[[4067.09]]and therefore I think being more
[[4071.13]]holistic help at least notion as a
[[4074.41]]company energy we're trying to be
[[4078.37]]holistic also help our keep our company
[[4083.57]]team very small like we're usually one
[[4088.93]]of the smallest relative to our business
[[4094.41]]scale because people can think can do
[[4099.37]]more can be more holistic and people
[[4103.25]]enjoy that too because they can do more
[[4107.41]]things it doesn't feels like they have
[[4111.49]]one role they have to be doing that
[[4114.97]]repeatedly has a lot of different
[[4118.45]]benefits but it's much harder to find
[[4122.77]]such people and important question here
[[4127.89]]please so if I think about the first
[[4132.45]]office and this may or may not be uh
[[4138.45]]true still um no is a no shoes was a no
[[4144.53]]shoes place did this contribute to the
[[4147.89]]company
[[4152.13]]energy I'm Asian so when you go home you
[[4158.09]]take off your shoes our first office no
[[4164.81]]shoes lasts us to 10ish people second
[[4172.09]]office 20ish people no shoes third of us
[[4178.33]]no shoes it actually has heated floor so
[[4182.93]]even better oh very those all in the
[[4187.13]]mission and the fourth office we try to
[[4193.09]]do no shoes still in the mission um I
[[4199.17]]think I made a wrong choice in the rock
[[4204.49]]the rock kind of hard when you it's a h
[[4208.93]]based Rock so when you step on it
[[4212.73]]without shoes with socks only it's just
[[4218.05]]all hurts so we decide not to do no
[[4223.85]]shoes at forth office and uh so far has
[[4228.85]]been stuck that way yeah P intuition has
[[4233.93]]socks and uh slippers at the front so
[[4239.25]]that way if you need the padding I know
[[4243.49]]but then where the question is like
[[4247.21]]where do you store your slippers it
[[4252.41]]become stinky like it's aesthetic yes if
[[4257.29]]you come to our office it's like we're
[[4262.65]]still try to be um not corporate it's
[[4267.41]]like they we're trying to use the
[[4270.77]]furniture that people use for homes I'm
[[4274.65]]pretty picky about what kind of
[[4278.25]]furniture is in office like ideally
[[4282.53]]designed classic that last 50 plus years
[[4287.93]]so Inspire us to build software that way
[[4292.73]]right so they made they also made
[[4296.93]]trade-offs people who design a chair
[[4301.45]]make t they made really interesting
[[4305.21]]trade off Force to solve certain
[[4309.29]]problems if you know the history of it
[[4315.09]]so we try to in the office use good
[[4321.13]]software good chairs good lighting so
[[4325.01]]this back to the aesthetic point that I
[[4328.25]]made earlier I actually felt that in the
[[4331.77]]offices as well there's that ongoing
[[4335.49]]cohesion even the music I remember I
[[4338.89]]think it was in the second office was it
[[4342.21]]was always jazz in the background and I
[[4345.85]]just felt like it all kind of was this
[[4350.49]]consistent Vibe you know so it's pretty
[[4355.69]]cool within notion are you using a
[[4361.25]]singular um underlying l l or are you at
[[4365.85]]this point using multiple different
[[4368.21]]things for different use cases you
[[4371.41]]mentioned sort of the highle reasoning
[[4376.17]]versus the fast Jeep sort of synthesis
[[4382.57]]we try everything open air and Tropic um
[[4389.37]]are the high-end model
[[4395.25]]uh we want reasoning which is we work
[[4402.01]]with the high-end model right uh yeah
[[4408.21]]it's kind of like everybody building
[[4413.49]]different flavors of this MH so yeah
[[4418.37]]makes sense and then as you look at um
[[4421.73]]it feels like with no there's a set of
[[4426.17]]core sort of templates or use cases um
[[4430.37]]you know there's things around project
[[4434.05]]management there's other types of almost
[[4437.89]]like applications that people have built
[[4441.33]]to use there's knowledge based related
[[4444.81]]stuff there's the things that you
[[4448.81]]mentioned um are any of those you feel
[[4452.69]]differentially impacted in terms of how
[[4455.81]]you think about future AI R map or
[[4460.05]]things that you know will really change
[[4463.97]]the game dramatically in terms of some
[[4467.17]]of these areas yeah I would say rack
[[4472.13]]changed all the knowledge say
[[4478.29]]fundamentally um you no longer need to
[[4485.13]]organize so the notion one of thing
[[4491.73]]people love is the life sidebar right
[[4496.17]]the life sidebar you can organize your
[[4499.85]]knowledge base organize your personal
[[4504.05]]workspace maybe the future doesn't have
[[4510.33]]to have that like what it's like to um
[[4517.09]]you know not fall into your own
[[4522.09]]Innovative Dilemma to double down that
[[4526.73]]your ex Paradigm but just having a
[[4530.61]]notion that you can just dump things and
[[4533.93]]retrieve right that's knowledge sty
[[4536.77]]that's actually really interesting at a
[[4540.05]]high level to think that um everything
[[4543.93]]sort of moves to a form of search over
[[4548.29]]time move over to search over time like
[[4552.25]]you're kind of losing organ you don't
[[4555.45]]need to self-organize information
[[4559.25]]anymore no in this new world you can
[[4563.49]]just create a mechanism to interrogate
[[4567.57]]it yeah at least like you you don't
[[4571.05]]organize your brain you just dump into
[[4574.41]]it then you wake up all you remember
[[4578.25]]that thing right so like it's
[[4582.45]]interesting some people do like the the
[[4586.05]]art of lowkey the art of memory you
[[4590.21]]actually or visualize your brain but for
[[4594.29]]most people it just works without any
[[4598.09]]organization and magically right what is
[[4603.25]]like for software we're getting there
[[4610.13]]right yeah it's kind of fun are there um
[[4617.05]]areas of uh software more broadly that
[[4621.61]]you think are outside of notion scope
[[4624.29]]that you think are going to change a
[[4630.29]]great deal from AI wow
[[4635.21]]um in some sense it's kind of a race
[[4641.21]]there's like the we're in the B Notions
[[4648.17]]in the bundling business where are
[[4656.65]]um we are uh we're in the bundling and
[[4663.17]]front office business front office my
[[4667.41]]definition our definition is what's
[[4672.73]]happening in like imagine a 1960s office
[[4678.73]]right what's in 1960 office on your desk
[[4682.97]]you have a notepad you write on
[[4687.69]]something you maybe have a typewriter um
[[4692.21]]then you have your binders on the left
[[4695.77]]and right to that's essentially the
[[4700.09]]notepad is your documents your notes and
[[4704.81]]notion your binders of things are like
[[4709.97]]your weeky knowledge based in notion and
[[4714.81]]behind you will be the file cabinet
[[4718.89]]that's your relational datab is in Ocean
[[4722.49]]right and you have a little push card to
[[4726.33]]put thing into there then there's a back
[[4730.69]]office whereas like the Librarians
[[4735.25]]organize all the things and that's
[[4740.05]]snowflake right that's the back in the
[[4744.73]]days IBM we don't touch that uh we
[[4748.73]]largely touch our strength like I
[[4753.77]]mentioned is software interface UI ux
[[4758.73]]which is largely what's in front of the
[[4762.09]]human we're trying to bundle in this in
[[4767.09]]one space at the same time there's also
[[4773.97]]largely back office power use cases they
[[4780.37]]tend to be vertic cides specific to
[[4787.05]]Health Care specific to some kind of
[[4793.17]]workflows very specific by very
[[4797.65]]essential to store somewhere and the
[[4802.77]]vertical integrate that use cases uh
[[4807.77]]that could be aifi too and people in
[[4812.33]]fact we see this in law we see this in a
[[4817.45]]bunch very specialized thing that people
[[4821.85]]have that domain knowledge and trying to
[[4825.73]]figure out how do you um instead of
[[4830.37]]human shuffling this let language model
[[4835.89]]help a lot of that right um the front
[[4840.37]]office type of things it's kind of
[[4844.01]]open-ended the back office power things
[[4848.65]]tend to be specific so I think it will
[[4853.37]]be a race but the market is just so
[[4858.49]]large and it doesn't it's not Zero Sum
[[4863.77]]necessarily maybe you can talk about the
[[4869.17]]market as you see it for notion so you
[[4874.33]]know when you guys began I think early
[[4879.53]]adopter startups were the first to um
[[4885.77]]get onto notion for knowledge base um
[[4890.69]]you're a much bigger company now we're
[[4894.41]]also in a different macro where um you
[[4898.73]]know startup budgets are are uh less
[[4902.81]]robust like how do you think about the
[[4906.05]]Enterprise and helping the Enterprise
[[4909.69]]adopt AI or or you know do Knowledge
[[4914.81]]Management yeah we're still very uh
[[4922.61]]early uh not at scale yet um I would say
[[4930.25]]uh bundling in trans do a lot of good
[[4935.41]]things one is you don't have to jump
[[4939.69]]between different tabs to do things
[[4944.77]]second is save your cost right like we
[[4950.17]]save a lot of customers bills for their
[[4955.61]]project management Tool uh around their
[[4962.65]]issue tracking tool and and that's
[[4968.41]]Enterprise really care about that it's
[[4973.69]]the very CFO friendly today um with this
[[4980.77]]macro so yeah spond only has many good
[[4986.61]]benefits besides M besides information
[[4990.77]]there is also money well Ian I mean this
[[4993.85]]conversation has spent so many
[[4995.93]]interesting topics thanks so much for
