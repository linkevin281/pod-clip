[[0]]today we're joined by EO Liberty CEO and
[[3.36]]founder of pine cone Pine cone's a
[[6.68]]vector database that's raised over $130
[[11.2]]million most recently at a $750 million
[[15.24]]valuation and they've really become a
[[18.32]]core part of the common set of tools
[[21.88]]that folks use to build AI apps we hit
[[25.24]]on a bunch of really interesting areas
[[28.44]]including the vector database landscape
[[31.84]]and how it's evolving common barriers
[[34.92]]that enterprises have to building
[[38.52]]effective AI apps Ando also shared his
[[42.04]]thoughts on the infrastructure and AI
[[44.96]]opportunities ahead in the application
[[48.12]]layer as well I think folks are really
[[51.04]]going to enjoy this definitely stick
[[53.8]]around for patent my debrief here at
[[57.92]]unsupervised learning
[[62.0]]you know thanks so much for uh for
[[65.12]]coming on really appreciate it thank you
[[68.68]]guys you know you were obviously working
[[72.6]]on Pine Cone before this generative AI
[[76.28]]craze and you know the launch of chat
[[80.64]]GPT and what was it like for you guys
[[85.24]]when chat GPT came out I mean was it
[[88.68]]like immediately clear there's going to
[[91.84]]be some spike in usage or when did you
[[95.4]]first kind of start observing just uh
[[99.28]]the insanity that I imagine followed
[[103.56]]I'll start by saying that Vector bases I
[[110.52]]think are uh still vastly underutilized
[[117.76]]for a lot of use cases for semantic
[[123.08]]search for candidate generation for
[[131.0]]ranking for feed ranking for like
[[137.68]]recommendation for a million different
[[140.68]]things right when I started building
[[144.52]]Pine con this was really it was sort of
[[149.12]]like a well-kept secret well a
[[153.72]]well-known secret I should say that the
[[158.16]]bigger companies like Google Amazon you
[[162.96]]know whatever like use that
[[168.04]]internally for search for recommendation
[[172.24]]for feed ranking for anomaly detection
[[175.92]]and so on but then educating the market
[[181.8]]was fairly difficult and I would go to
[[188.32]]you know investors and say you know
[[192.52]]database and they would kind of look at
[[196.8]]me confused and and concerned and I'm
[[201.56]]sure they emailed you in in 2023 and
[[205.12]]they were like we believed all along
[[208.2]]right we've always been fans of the
[[213.04]]category yeah uh actually I'll tell you
[[218.72]]funny a funny thing that I the actual
[[223.84]]emails I got after that but just to make
[[229.0]]matters worse I had just come out of AWS
[[233.12]]where I I helped build a product called
[[237.72]]sag maker which was EML Ops thing and
[[244.4]]like EML Ops was like all the older age
[[251.84]]uh you know before you know AI kind of
[[257.76]]took off right so everybody thought it
[[262.84]]was building a like an mlops product
[[267.72]]right so everybody was very happy to
[[270.96]]meet with me and then be very
[[273.72]]disappointed that I'm building something
[[277.2]]called the vector database what is that
[[281.68]]like it sounds like saying right and
[[288.44]]then with open AI just kind of
[[296.08]]elevating uh the discussion to the
[[301.4]]broader audience like the technology
[[305.08]]really hasn't changed significantly to
[[309.36]]be honest I mean the the the for
[[315.12]]practitioners like nothing very deep has
[[319.96]]changed except for the fact that now
[[323.48]]there was a lot of oomph behind it a lot
[[328.08]]of capital and a lot of energy behind it
[[333.96]]so it started started being accessed by
[[341.0]]the non AI engineer when that started
[[347.72]]happening we started ramping up so
[[352.76]]quickly that we started really
[[357.92]]exhausting whole all kinds of machines
[[365.08]]in in gcp and AWS clouds we started like
[[371.56]]really spending millions of dollars a
[[376.76]]month on our free tier it was complete
[[383.0]]Insanity it was uh the entire team was
[[389.04]]dedicated just like spinning up more and
[[393.44]]more environments and just being able to
[[397.48]]keep up with the demand I think at our
[[402.2]]Peak we started having 10,000 signups
[[407.76]]every day uh which really pushed us to
[[414.84]]really think about scale and effic iy in
[[420.96]]a completely different way like we we
[[425.52]]kind of we had to go back to the drawing
[[431.28]]board and redesign the entire solution
[[436.68]]which later yielded the solution we have
[[441.08]]in place called now called serverless
[[445.64]]which is like maybe two orders of Mag
[[449.64]]more efficient but it kind of came out
[[453.68]]of just necessity we just couldn't we
[[458.08]]literally couldn't handle the
[[462.48]]load uh the funny thing is if you want
[[468.24]]to talk about Investors right I did have
[[473.4]]quite a few different investors write to
[[477.72]]me after like that like vector that
[[482.92]]basis have become like the like a true
[[487.04]]category in some sense we've already
[[491.32]]taken the lead and they say they went
[[496.84]]when they when they wrote to me and said
[[502.12]]hey you know I actually looked back at
[[507.8]]the notes that I took like three years
[[513.52]]ago and you actually said you were going
[[518.48]]to build
[[520.96]]this and I like yeah uh because that
[[526.12]]that's what I was going to build and
[[530.76]]they're like okay like we just that just
[[535.76]]not very common that somebody says
[[538.84]]they're going to build something and
[[541.08]]they actually build it and that's
[[544.32]]actually succeeds like that's just not
[[549.68]]very common I'm like so funny I guess
[[554.32]]they they'd all thought it was uh in
[[557.44]]mlops platform but then they they read
[[560.56]]they read back through their notes and
[[563.4]]they they realized what it was what it
[[567.92]]was all along exactly was there like a
[[573.0]]particular moment that you can remember
[[577.48]]that like spiked usage you know early on
[[581.36]]was it like immediately apparent to
[[584.08]]folks as they were playing around with
[[586.76]]gpt3 that they needed the vector
[[590.08]]database or was there like a tweet or
[[593.64]]something something or uh in the early
[[597.8]]days of that usage spiking I think one
[[602.72]]of one of the kind of moments that
[[607.68]]really just completely blew up there was
[[611.76]]this
[[615.0]]uh
[[620.0]]uh uh there was this open source like
[[627.0]]gadget called a auto GPT that was this
[[631.76]]sort of
[[637.08]]like super like minimalistic but sort of
[[643.2]]like precursor to something we would
[[648.32]]call an agent now and it was sort of
[[652.56]]like
[[655.52]]a a piece of nothing it was really just
[[658.32]]like
[[663.32]]a uh what I think even one python file
[[669.32]]or just a handful of python files with
[[674.68]]some like spit and gum and you know
[[680.96]]whatever but it it like like agents do
[[685.28]]it started like doing something
[[688.28]]potentially interesting it was open
[[691.52]]source and so on that thing just took
[[694.88]]off like
[[700.16]]crazy and you know
[[705.76]]suddenly the people's assorted
[[710.92]]onboarding pine cone were not systems
[[718.08]]engineer building AI platforms and rag
[[725.56]]applications and and so on they were
[[732.08]]like the dentist that remembers python
[[737.6]]from college and wants to play with AI
[[742.56]]right and then like things just
[[746.92]]completely went insane like because
[[751.72]]there's way more
[[754.56]]dentists I guess a lot of dentists that
[[758.84]]uh that remember their luckily enough
[[763.96]]that kind of like normalized again and
[[768.72]]the people who come today oh mostly
[[772.88]]Builders but for a while there it just
[[777.88]]completely went insane yeah it seems
[[782.48]]like there's a a huge breadth of
[[786.52]]applications that are built on top of of
[[791.72]]pine cone what are some of your favorite
[[796.52]]applications or or some of the ones that
[[799.72]]that really stand out to you obviously
[[804.12]]we're talking about notion before and um
[[808.72]]and it sounds like pine cone really
[[812.2]]shines for scale as well when people
[[816.6]]have kind of millions of vectors that um
[[821.24]]that they want to to run workloads on
[[825.56]]top of so Millions is actually the small
[[829.88]]scale today when we speak with customers
[[833.76]]and they have millions of vectos we say
[[837.04]]great
[[841.76]]uh you KN knock yourself out you'll be
[[846.52]]hard pressed to spend more than 100
[[851.48]]bucks a month uh like you really are
[[857.04]]going to have to exert energy to try to
[[863.44]]do that right where we truly shine is at
[[870.44]]the hundreds of millions the billions
[[876.72]]scale where companies themselves are are
[[884.08]]sass uh in and often times like software
[[890.56]]providers notion is a great example gong
[[895.36]]is a great example many others that
[[901.12]]actually they themselves develop AI Q&A
[[908.96]]semantic search like deep AI solutions
[[916.48]]for their own customers data so they
[[921.44]]like each one of their own customers
[[925.56]]might have a million documents right but
[[930.48]]they themselves and have 10,000
[[934.92]]customers and suddenly they find
[[938.76]]themselves needing a vabase that can
[[943.64]]handle 10 billion ineds maybe across a
[[948.68]]thousand partitions
[[953.28]]or 10,000 partitions and do that
[[959.04]]incredibly cost effectively right and
[[965.12]]when you try to do that especially
[[970.04]]nowadays where people really start
[[973.6]]understanding hey I'm not just playing
[[977.08]]in the lab I'm building a tree a true
[[980.28]]product so I really need to care about
[[984.8]]unit economics they want to figure out
[[990.6]]what's like what's that going to cost me
[[994.96]]and then we can come in and say hey
[[998.6]]because of our new architecture because
[[1003.04]]we went through this insane spike a year
[[1007.84]]and a half ago and we've re architected
[[1011.6]]everything and now we've launched it as
[[1016.76]]serverless we can run this multi-tenant
[[1025.0]]workload such that one of you your cost
[[1032.28]]for one of your paying customers on Pine
[[1040.16]]Cone might be a dollar a year like like
[[1049.2]]sometimes 50 cents a year right for a
[[1055.88]]paying user right and then the unit
[[1061.04]]economics really shine right so you you
[[1065.84]]said you know if you have a million you
[[1070.4]]know vector right I mean a a million
[[1074.36]]vectors like okay if you have a million
[[1078.08]]vectors 10,000 times you really don't
[[1081.64]]want that to be 100 bucks each you
[[1084.76]]really want each one of them to be 50
[[1088.96]]cents each and then that starts making
[[1094.52]]sense right uh and that's where we truly
[[1099.96]]shine because then you really can can
[[1104.68]]operate this thing at scale on the
[[1109.76]]application side are most people running
[[1116.48]]rag or doing semantic search or um I
[[1121.6]]guess what types of applications do you
[[1126.48]]see I can imagine you know the Q&A at
[[1132.16]]notion that's kind of one and then I can
[[1136.08]]imagine there's tons that gong is doing
[[1139.6]]as well with with vectors and turning
[[1143.76]]videos into vectors yeah Q&A and
[[1147.8]]semantic search are very large
[[1152.92]]applications very well understood chat
[[1160.4]]Bots support Bots uh which are sort of
[[1167.64]]like Q&A if you will uh but in special
[[1174.88]]flavor of that uh people do uh legal
[[1181.92]]Discovery U medical history Discovery
[[1186.68]]and all sorts of you know analytics on
[[1189.64]]that
[[1192.24]]uh which again you can think about them
[[1196.32]]as flavors of search in in some sense
[[1200.64]]right there's a lot more that has to do
[[1204.48]]with images and audio and video and
[[1208.88]]anomaly detection and security which is
[[1213.36]]starting to become like a big thing
[[1217.92]]Pharma and Drug Discovery are you know
[[1222.56]]we see some applications like that but
[[1227.2]]the kind of meat and potato is really
[[1233.16]]just the kind of text and and images and
[[1239.92]]search and uh you know rag over that in
[[1245.2]]some sense and by the way rag in and of
[[1249.08]]itself is sort of like like you know
[[1253.04]]based on semantic search it's it's like
[[1258.08]]the the kind of the magic sauce happens
[[1262.92]]at the ma at the semantic search layer
[[1267.4]]not at the reformulation the year that
[[1271.36]]makes a lot of sense and and and I guess
[[1274.08]]obviously you know I think in the
[[1276.92]]beginning folks have used you know
[[1280.36]]embeddings for it feels like mostly Text
[[1283.48]]data and there's been you know some in
[[1286.2]]the image world but I'm wondering you
[[1289.04]]know we've had different perspectives on
[[1292.12]]on this podcast about you know how much
[[1295.36]]multimodal stuff we'll see this year and
[[1298.44]]whether you know I'm curious you
[[1302.28]]obviously have a firsthand view to it uh
[[1306.36]]you know are you seeing lots of folks uh
[[1310.36]]working with image and video data and
[[1314.04]]and do you think that we have the
[[1317.28]]underlying tools required to for those
[[1321.24]]use cases today or or you still expected
[[1326.16]]to be a text dominant 2024 so look I
[[1333.64]]mean I am unfortunately I've been in AI
[[1341.08]]or machine learning before that or Big
[[1345.56]]Data before that or all that you know
[[1350.68]]for 20 years now and
[[1356.08]]so
[[1362.16]]uh uh I think I have a good mix of uh
[[1369.68]]enthusiasm about the the the promise of
[[1375.44]]tomorrow and a healthy focus on the
[[1382.0]]problems of yesterday right uh even
[[1388.64]]today right with the advance
[[1393.96]]of foundational models and you know
[[1399.32]]General Ai and all that
[[1405.04]]stuff the average Company still finds it
[[1410.4]]hard to even like train any deep
[[1415.48]]learning model at all yeah like anything
[[1420.2]]like a million parameter not a billion
[[1424.92]]not 10 billion not General AI nothing
[[1431.2]]like any model same goes to search and
[[1436.84]]and so on so you know I think we need to
[[1440.56]]be
[[1444.36]]very
[[1452.04]]uh kind of realistic about what is
[[1460.04]]possible right by the Trailblazers the
[[1466.16]]research labs and the technology leaders
[[1472.52]]and what is an actual technology that
[[1478.68]]companies actually use right and those
[[1484.0]]could be five years apart sometimes
[[1489.0]]right so can we already see amazing
[[1494.84]]things with multimodal for sure right do
[[1500.04]]I think multimodal is going to head the
[[1504.48]]kind of mainstream technology developer
[[1509.88]]in the next year or two unlikely yeah I
[[1513.92]]mean I think it's interesting because
[[1516.2]]you you are working hand inand with
[[1519.68]]these companies that are uh deploying in
[[1523.16]]many times their their first generative
[[1526.8]]AI products and so I imagine you do see
[[1530.72]]these barriers or or the places where
[[1534.2]]folks fall down and being able to do
[[1537.4]]that like what do you feel like the
[[1540.36]]biggest barriers today in terms of
[[1543.76]]getting you know these training these
[[1546.76]]models and getting them into production
[[1549.76]]for some of the classic use cases that
[[1553.44]]we're seeing around you know support or
[[1557.88]]or search or others I mean one of the
[[1562.96]]biggest ones is hallucinations right
[[1567.4]]they're just they're not trustworthy
[[1570.56]]right they just
[[1574.88]]don't whatever they they're compelled
[[1579.6]]they're large language models they're
[[1584.32]]designed to generate language right uh
[[1589.72]]and when you are compelled to write a
[[1593.72]]page of text on something you know
[[1596.36]]nothing
[[1600.76]]about you will write a page of text uh
[[1607.52]]and that will contain stuff
[[1612.52]]you know Pat and I do that all the time
[[1616.28]]I was going to say yeah we've all been
[[1621.2]]in like sixth grade
[[1627.12]]and I remember that experience very well
[[1634.12]]like cold sweat I'm like [ __ ] um that's
[[1641.48]]the mode we put these llms in right uh
[[1647.16]]and so like and then we're so sort of
[[1652.08]]like surprised that what comes out is is
[[1657.68]]nonsense right I think that's a huge
[[1662.04]]problem and I think that's something
[[1666.44]]that we as a technology would have to a
[[1671.36]]society I mean not we Pine con I mean we
[[1675.92]]the world have to Grapple with and
[[1681.2]]really bring really good solutions to I
[[1686.96]]think it will start with AI startups and
[[1692.56]]technology companies that build on Pine
[[1697.36]]Cone build on models and so on that have
[[1701.52]]already know how to work with those
[[1706.16]]Technologies building great vertical
[[1712.64]]solutions for support for medical
[[1719.16]]history for legal Discovery for you know
[[1723.8]]you name it like that's a very long list
[[1729.04]]of applications right right and then I
[[1735.0]]think two three years down the line you
[[1740.48]]would see maturity in the broader Market
[[1747.92]]where now like every large company would
[[1754.2]]use some of those tools but would also
[[1758.92]]use Vector bases and models and you know
[[1764.28]]visibility and like a bunch of other AI
[[1769.36]]specific Technologies kind of natively
[[1774.0]]for for the own development where this
[[1777.04]]has
[[1781.84]]become so commonplace so well understood
[[1789.0]]so Ironclad and so well like ingrained
[[1794.4]]in the developer culture that just
[[1798.56]]people whatever there's just enough
[[1802.04]]there that people just know how to use
[[1805.0]]it well I feel like hallucinations come
[[1808.44]]up time and time again I guess have have
[[1811.4]]you seen what what do you feel like the
[[1814.08]]best way to you know for for folks
[[1816.88]]listening they they're also trying to
[[1819.52]]figure this out what are what are some
[[1822.12]]of the best things you're seeing in
[[1825.28]]terms of ways to get around this there
[[1829.56]]are a few different really important
[[1834.32]]efforts on this front first of all we we
[[1840.64]]are only now starting to truly be able
[[1848.56]]to even measure hallucinations
[[1852.56]]right to even know like you can for
[[1857.24]]example you can design a model I can
[[1863.44]]write a model uh that never hallucinates
[[1870.64]]by just always saying I don't know
[[1877.92]]right right that's not hallucinating
[[1884.64]]right it's also completely useless but
[[1890.6]]it it never makes a mistake and you know
[[1897.6]]whatever like it never miss steps right
[[1905.2]]uh okay is this worthwhile like should
[[1912.12]]we should we uh celebrate that outcome I
[[1917.48]]don't think so right okay so you really
[[1921.88]]want to measure kind of usefulness and
[[1928.16]]correctness and faithfulness to the data
[[1933.84]]that you were trained on or the data
[[1937.24]]that you have in a vual database to do
[[1941.76]]ragon and so on so the just these
[[1948.16]]measures of even what is good is is is
[[1954.72]]already like a very complicated question
[[1961.2]]and I think that there is a uh a another
[[1967.92]]huge effort that has to do with frankly
[[1973.0]]with Rag and with Vector databases and
[[1978.72]]with knowledge layers and capacities and
[[1985.4]]people grappling with okay how do I now
[[1992.2]]make my data available to the model in a
[[1997.76]]way that's secure that is well
[[2003.0]]understood that is data governed that
[[2008.92]]you know I can maybe delete stuff that I
[[2014.08]]whatever like I was gdpr told me that I
[[2018.92]]have to delete and somehow I need to
[[2023.24]]know for a fact it's not somehow a part
[[2028.96]]of model anymore and so on um there's a
[[2034.4]]lot of work there and that's you know a
[[2037.96]]topic we actually made a lot of progress
[[2042.36]]on already so by we again I mean not
[[2047.8]]only pine cone but this like Community
[[2052.32]]like starts to have pretty good
[[2057.68]]solutions for super cool it seems like a
[[2064.24]]Hacker News Post in the making an llm
[[2069.52]]that will never hallucinate just respond
[[2075.96]]with I don't know every single time
[[2080.16]]uh like creatively avoid the question
[[2086.48]]exactly but we know like we know I mean
[[2093.36]]jokes aside we we already today can load
[[2100.12]]all of whatever like a oh but a good
[[2104.0]]chunk of the
[[2109.04]]internet uh into pine cone as as an
[[2116.04]]index and basically R run like a
[[2122.4]]language model next to it with you know
[[2127.72]]not incredibly sophisticated Rag and
[[2134.08]]already outperform gp4 like today it's
[[2140.4]]we've already ran experiments like this
[[2145.16]]so like I I think there's something
[[2149.0]]there and I think we're we're going to
[[2153.08]]see some significant progress there both
[[2159.84]]on sort of like consumer facing products
[[2169.92]]and like B2B products vectors are the
[[2178.92]]language of AI U or kind of what AI
[[2184.12]]speaks and there's this land grab to
[[2188.32]]store them everyone wants to store the
[[2192.16]]vectors and because of that there's kind
[[2195.4]]of been this explosion I mean you would
[[2198.04]]know this better than than us but
[[2201.68]]there's been this explosion of startups
[[2205.76]]uh that are going after storing vectors
[[2209.6]]but then also incumbents and folks like
[[2213.24]][ __ ] that are adding support for
[[2216.72]]vectors so how do you think about the
[[2220.6]]landscape of you know the startups that
[[2225.76]]are kind of vying to to store some of
[[2230.6]]these workloads and then the incumbents
[[2234.64]]as well don't get me started about [ __ ]
[[2239.68]]it's a company that freaking heard the
[[2244.48]]word AI for the first time a year ago
[[2248.6]]and suddenly they're like experts so I
[[2251.68]]mean
[[2255.68]]don't whatever like storing vectors I
[[2260.56]]think is exactly what's happening and I
[[2264.56]]think you define it perfectly right
[[2268.68]]people understand that now this is a
[[2274.48]]data type right next to my sentences or
[[2280.68]]my images I'm going to store a semantic
[[2285.36]]representation of that object that came
[[2290.36]]out of some embedding model right and
[[2295.76]]that thing is a float array right it's
[[2300.64]]whatever like a thousand floats right
[[2307.0]]and if your infrastructure be it like a
[[2315.0]]non- AI technology say that rhymes with
[[2320.8]]Bongo uh
[[2325.32]]you know you need to put that array of
[[2330.0]]numbers somewhere and so they have to
[[2334.56]]have that as a type really and that's
[[2339.96]]basically what's happening there right
[[2345.84]]and so you know whatever you there's
[[2351.48]]some work that has to be done to do that
[[2357.24]]that doesn't make your database natively
[[2362.4]]be able to query those things and work
[[2368.04]]with that data type at all right what
[[2373.64]]people don't understand about Vector
[[2378.4]]bases and why they're so unique is that
[[2381.92]]that
[[2385.88]]that numeric array becomes in some sense
[[2392.76]]the key some conceptual way that is the
[[2398.96]]primary lookup that is the way you
[[2403.8]]organize data on blob storage that's how
[[2409.04]]you load segments that's how you you
[[2414.48]]know search through the your Universe by
[[2418.68]]the way that's how your own brain does
[[2422.24]]it right I mean this is an incredibly
[[2427.8]]unique and optimized stack that if you
[[2434.68]]you know try to somehow bolt on this
[[2440.04]]like data type and like pretend that
[[2444.0]]it's now a vector database you're going
[[2448.96]]to get incredibly poor performance and
[[2454.6]]and flank run into like serious issues
[[2458.36]]now I mean I think it's it's really
[[2461.76]]interesting because um you know I feel
[[2465.36]]like obviously yeah a lot of a lot of
[[2469.68]]other folks have um have come into the
[[2473.92]]space and I think generally there's been
[[2477.08]]this question of like you know what's
[[2480.84]]the what's the rag stack end up being
[[2483.88]]and I feel like you guys get thrown
[[2486.6]]around all the time as as a key part of
[[2490.44]]that and I'm wondering like if you uh
[[2494.04]]you know if you had to go to a company
[[2497.96]]today uh and build a rag product like
[[2502.44]]what would be your stack besides pine
[[2507.68]]cone of course that's interesting I I I
[[2513.48]]frankly I think a lot of people default
[[2517.28]]to open
[[2522.96]]a uh I I wouldn't we actually see really
[[2531.8]]good performance out of smaller
[[2540.72]]cheaper uh somehow easier to manage
[[2547.76]]sometime open source models the there is
[[2552.52]]no reason to spend a ton of money on
[[2556.36]]that there
[[2561.64]]is sort of like like an ml etling part
[[2567.12]]of it has to do with bulk
[[2571.04]]Transformations and movement of data and
[[2576.0]]so on we've really started enjoying any
[[2581.6]]scales product and we really like start
[[2586.88]]partnering with them closer and we're
[[2591.24]]really enjoying their
[[2597.32]]stack uh we work with h forel and others
[[2605.2]]on kind of uh launching applications and
[[2612.36]]and you know building the the you know
[[2617.24]]kind of app
[[2621.16]]layer uh you know we partner pretty
[[2628.16]]closely with coher and AI 21 and and uh
[[2636.44]]you know we're put you know others like
[[2642.72]]hugging face and others like we're all
[[2646.84]]whatever they're all in the mix we see I
[[2650.92]]think a good combination of of those
[[2656.44]]models both for embedding and for uh
[[2662.56]]ranking and summarization and so on I
[[2668.88]]really don't have a good vendor for or a
[[2675.32]]good technology for evaluation yet that
[[2679.8]]I'm you know I'm going to some people
[[2682.28]]people are going to write back to me
[[2684.68]]that they're angry that I didn't name
[[2689.12]]them but uh I think
[[2697.52]]that uh uh that'd be very interesting to
[[2705.96]]for a a leader to emerge in in that
[[2710.72]]stack I think it's it's it's very
[[2714.0]]interesting and it's very hard to do
[[2717.44]]right and and then as you think about
[[2720.44]]kind of like Pine cone's footprint I
[[2723.4]]mean obviously I imagine a key part of
[[2726.76]]of getting pine cone to work in an
[[2730.4]]Enterprise just having the data ready to
[[2734.4]]to be put into a vector database right
[[2737.96]]and I imagine there's all sorts of you
[[2741.0]]know we've obviously met companies that
[[2743.84]]are that are focused on that and then
[[2746.96]]there's you know the metadata you apply
[[2749.96]]to it obviously then the retrieval
[[2754.2]]methods you use to to uh to uh take it
[[2758.8]]from a vector database like how do you
[[2761.8]]think about ultimately like the
[[2764.88]]footprint you want to have versus you're
[[2768.08]]like I would love I would love there to
[[2771.04]]be a best-in-class vendor that's that's
[[2774.28]]great at the ETL side and and never have
[[2779.32]]to touch that yeah so um you're right I
[[2787.24]]mean I and by why I apologize to the the
[[2793.88]]the audience I'm like a I'm like a
[[2797.8]]infrastructure guy so I I kind of look
[[2802.72]]at the raw machines and like very basic
[[2807.4]]infrastructure a lot of
[[2813.12]]companies that uh are stepping into the
[[2819.4]]embedding generation and data generation
[[2824.4]]into V datab bases that're actually
[[2832.0]]doing really well right uh unstructured
[[2840.08]]uh comes to mind but that is becomes a
[[2846.6]]viable option like very soon and for
[[2852.72]]especially for specific channels right
[[2858.88]]so if you have a a fixed
[[2865.68]]so if you have a common data Channel say
[[2873.32]]you import your data say with five Tran
[[2880.2]]from Snowflake and now you have that
[[2886.96]]data in a in a table that has a
[[2894.08]]unified structure because whatever
[[2899.24]]because it's the same table that every
[[2904.68]]five Trend customer would have then
[[2909.92]]there are companies who would take that
[[2914.48]]and and transform it and fit it into a
[[2919.76]]vector base so you can rag over your you
[[2924.84]]know say you know Salesforce you know
[[2930.68]]notes on customers and so on right uh
[[2937.4]]and so if people if you understand that
[[2943.04]]the data source that you have is like
[[2947.88]]standard then it's very likely you will
[[2952.2]]find somebody who will have already buil
[[2955.92]]that pipeline be very happy to sell it
[[2960.6]]to you and you were talking about how uh
[[2965.16]]how effective some of the smaller models
[[2971.04]]can be relative to an open AI yeah how
[[2978.24]]much intelligence do you think will
[[2985.12]]happen at the vector DB retrieval step
[[2991.72]]versus at the generation step it sounds
[[2996.92]]like you know maybe over time people are
[[3000.6]]you know they want to run on on their
[[3005.56]]own data and and um you know maybe you
[[3011.52]]guys are seeing good results with with
[[3016.44]]that as well like I'll give an economics
[[3021.08]]answer to this right the Market's going
[[3026.6]]to have to find like the stable point
[[3032.88]]where there's a good tradeoff
[[3038.72]]between cost compute and infrastructure
[[3044.0]]that you're willing to run and the
[[3049.56]]quality of the output right we're
[[3055.76]]already at the point where making models
[[3063.48]]bigger on gpus is not reasonable you can
[[3070.64]]run an experiment you know you can flex
[[3075.4]]and say I have you know whatever 100
[[3080.52]]billion parameter model and it's
[[3087.64]]whatever it's like does XYZ but whatever
[[3093.96]]you're not going to run a 100 billion
[[3098.68]]parameter model for every API call on
[[3103.16]]your platform that's you're going to
[[3106.36]]just it's just you're going to go
[[3110.16]]bankrupt right and you're going to make
[[3115.72]]the planet hotter so like that that's
[[3121.12]]not going to work long term and so
[[3124.68]]people really have to find better
[[3128.28]]Solutions right again what we see is
[[3131.96]]that with those model
[[3136.76]]models uh if you do things right
[[3142.96]]sometimes the the results could even get
[[3148.32]]better and if they're even if they're
[[3153.36]]not better they're not noticeably worse
[[3158.76]]and you might be operating on like you
[[3163.8]]know cents on the dollar uh in terms of
[[3169.88]]operating costs right so yeah um I have
[[3176.16]]no doubt that we would move there that
[[3181.56]]doesn't mean the arms raised to whatever
[[3186.16]]like bigger better models not going to
[[3189.64]]exist I just don't think that's what the
[[3193.88]]Market's G to operate with the kind of
[[3197.56]]the most of the Market's going to
[[3201.12]]operate with it is interesting it feels
[[3204.84]]like as these context windows were
[[3207.96]]getting longer you know these last few
[[3211.96]]months people were like oh well you know
[[3215.76]]is is there a future for rag you just
[[3219.4]]stuff you know everything you'd want and
[[3223.28]]in impr prompt but I mean I'm curious
[[3226.12]]your thoughts on that it seems like from
[[3229.4]]a cost perspective obviously uh that
[[3232.64]]that you know if you're charging per
[[3235.68]]token that that can get pricey quickly
[[3240.88]]yeah I mean I I think the fact that
[[3246.48]]model companies allow you to bring in a
[[3251.12]]bigger and a bigger context I mean I
[[3254.84]]think this is the least surprising thing
[[3258.2]]in the world that's their pricing model
[[3263.04]]right what like shockingly enough
[[3268.16]]they're willing for you to pay them more
[[3273.24]]what what a what a you know what a
[[3278.68]]shocker there multiple problems with not
[[3283.64]]only is it slow and expensive it doesn't
[[3289.4]]actually help more often than not right
[[3297.0]]and uh and finally it just runs out of
[[3304.8]]steam right you can say Hey you know
[[3311.0]]whatever like write me a job description
[[3315.52]]and here is an example job description
[[3319.24]]to go off of great that's great for a
[[3324.88]]context window right if like here like
[[3332.36]]10 job descriptions to go off of okay
[[3338.56]]that also works he a million job
[[3344.36]]descriptions to go off of like okay
[[3350.76]]that's not going to work right or
[[3356.08]]whatever like write something and then
[[3360.44]]get information from the web or get
[[3364.68]]information from all of my documentation
[[3371.28]]ever right uh that just doesn't work I
[[3378.6]]mean just think about that like sending
[[3384.76]]all your company data to open
[[3391.96]]AI on every query like that clearly is
[[3398.88]]not the right thing
[[3403.6]]totally I mean it makes it makes all the
[[3407.0]]more sense as you focus on these perfect
[[3410.12]]uses for pinec con that are hundreds of
[[3412.8]]millions of vectors it's like those are
[[3415.6]]exactly the ones that you know would
[[3418.68]]would never make any sense to stuff in a
[[3422.36]]context window yeah but but even even
[[3428.4]]even at the small scale I again I'm you
[[3434.44]]know I want to paint the extreme because
[[3438.48]]like that's where it becomes like almost
[[3443.04]]like faral like obviously impossible
[[3449.24]]right but even when you can create like
[[3456.68]]a whatever put a 100,000 tokens in a in
[[3461.92]]in a context
[[3465.76]]window I mean putting those documents in
[[3469.76]]a vector database you might be able to
[[3473.04]]send instead of 100,000 you''ll be able
[[3475.76]]to send
[[3479.68]]10,000 and that' be just as good if not
[[3485.6]]better whatever 3,000 and you'd be
[[3492.84]]paying whatever like 10% and not lose
[[3501.44]]any performance so why not right and so
[[3508.32]]again even small cases where the context
[[3513.96]]engine is theoretically workable even
[[3520.12]]then it's very rarely that right the
[[3525.36]]best solution in terms of cost and
[[3529.92]]performance totally and I guess just
[[3533.6]]generally as you think about how folks
[[3536.52]]are using pine cone today does it feel
[[3539.8]]like there's you know folks relatively
[[3542.88]]standardized around the embeddings
[[3546.16]]models they use or retrieval methods or
[[3549.32]]one thing I'm always curious about is
[[3553.08]]whether you know uh it feels like at in
[[3557.32]]the limit there will be you know
[[3560.16]]different retrieval methods for
[[3562.16]]different use cases and different
[[3564.36]]embedding models that are particularly
[[3567.12]]good for you know uh different
[[3570.48]]Industries and uh it's hard to tell from
[[3573.32]]the outside how much of that is
[[3575.92]]happening today versus like hey let's
[[3578.76]]just try and get this thing to work you
[[3582.24]]know know and and use uh but I'm curious
[[3586.28]]what you're seeing frankly most
[[3590.6]]companies are trying to get this to work
[[3598.12]]right very few companies have done it
[[3606.04]]long enough and have like really gotten
[[3610.96]]the experience with it that they really
[[3615.32]]start to now iterate over the embedding
[[3620.0]]models and the retrieval and the
[[3625.48]]reranking and the filtering and like
[[3631.16]]really get very deep in the application
[[3636.64]]stack and and figure out how to build
[[3642.36]]this and uh I think we're getting there
[[3646.52]]it's a part of the maturity in the
[[3650.28]]market like and the same way that any
[[3656.2]]search recommendation stack is it's not
[[3662.36]]just the retrieval there's like a lot
[[3667.68]]that goes before it and a lot that goes
[[3672.76]]after it uh to really get the results
[[3676.56]]that you need and this is one of the
[[3681.44]]main discussions that I have with larger
[[3687.4]]companies that I work with that you know
[[3691.28]]I tell them hey you know this is going
[[3695.68]]to be able to do amazing things but it's
[[3700.8]]not Magic I mean it's not you're not
[[3704.04]]going to just hook it up and
[[3707.92]]everything's going to be perfect this is
[[3712.28]]you know this is work you know we're
[[3716.24]]going to have scientists and Engineers
[[3721.56]]work on this thing for multiple quarters
[[3726.28]]and we're going to learn and iterate and
[[3730.32]]improve and add stuff and remove stuff
[[3735.92]]and we'll get there eventually we'll be
[[3742.4]]able to do Q&A incredibly well and you
[[3747.92]]know chat support and legal Discovery
[[3752.48]]and all that stuff it is possible
[[3756.64]]because we've been building these things
[[3761.36]]for years now and we know it's possible
[[3765.84]]we also know it's
[[3770.36]]not trivial like and every use case is
[[3775.04]]slightly different and every application
[[3779.08]]has different preferences and different
[[3784.04]]Comfort zones on the ratio between speed
[[3790.2]]and cost and accuracy and and format and
[[3795.4]]length of the input and the output and
[[3799.8]]like freshness of the data and like you
[[3804.52]]you name it there you just really have
[[3808.48]]to build up a whole solution around it
[[3811.88]]and that takes time and I imagine you
[[3814.4]]know one thing that must be interesting
[[3816.88]]for you as a business is and I've heard
[[3819.92]]this from other folks that selli tools
[[3823.4]]and Enterprises is you kind of land in
[[3826.96]]and I'm sure they're like oh this is
[[3830.0]]amazing we have you know EO and this
[[3833.24]]awesome pine cone team like build out
[[3836.92]]our Q&A you know product for us or
[[3840.04]]something and and you know they're so
[[3843.2]]excited to have you there and obviously
[[3847.36]]you know I think at at scale you you you
[[3851.0]]certainly want to be empowering the
[[3854.0]]developers in these companies to you
[[3857.72]]know uh to to build these things and to
[[3861.52]]tweak things themselves like how have
[[3864.72]]you thought about you know where you're
[[3867.44]]just hey it's the early days of the
[[3870.12]]space like we might as well just come in
[[3873.32]]and help them tune the knobs and and
[[3877.52]]make this implementation work uh versus
[[3882.04]]you know hey we really want to um we're
[[3884.84]]kind of about to be a little more
[[3887.72]]religious about them just you know being
[[3891.4]]playing around with with the different
[[3897.36]]things Pine has to offer so for uh the
[[3903.88]]first three years of the company's
[[3911.6]]existence uh my uh board was uh very
[[3920.68]]unhappy with me because we were almost
[[3927.16]]religiously not doing that like we would
[[3932.12]]get questions and we would whatever
[[3937.24]]everything that we
[[3943.6]]stood was needed we either documented
[[3949.4]]very clearly that we don't do or we made
[[3955.16]]it very very easy or maybe completely
[[3960.4]]transparent uh and pine con just
[[3963.64]]completely something you don't have to
[[3966.84]]do at all or something that we don't do
[[3971.6]]at all like either we take care of it
[[3978.92]]100% or we do zero% of it right and then
[[3987.04]]we were very explicit about that right
[[3993.28]]we had to often times have very
[[3998.24]]uncomfortable conversations with
[[4002.4]]potentially large customers that need
[[4006.76]]help with XYZ and we know how to do XYZ
[[4010.84]]and we tell them no we can't help you
[[4013.72]]because we're really busy building a
[[4017.32]]Victor database but that
[[4022.96]]really panned out in the growth phase of
[[4028.44]]the company where you you really started
[[4033.52]]having literally thousands of customers
[[4040.04]]who not only don't like seek our help
[[4046.44]]they're not willing to meet with
[[4053.64]]us they're like they're just happy and
[[4059.88]]successful and they don't want to waste
[[4063.32]]their time it's like hey this [ __ ] works
[[4066.44]]I don't I have better things to do I
[[4070.0]]don't need to talk to you guys I'm like
[[4074.92]]okay and so my sales team is agonizing
[[4079.6]]about like hey like this is whatever we
[[4082.72]]need to speak with them we don't know
[[4085.24]]who they are I'm like I don't know but
[[4087.48]]they don't want to talk to us what do
[[4090.2]]you want to do for the folks that like
[[4093.68]]you know maybe are not talking to you
[[4097.24]]and and can't get it to work like is
[[4101.04]]there one like thing you wish that
[[4104.92]]people tried more like oh if only you
[[4108.72]]would like use a different embeddings
[[4112.04]]model or I don't know whatever it is
[[4115.12]]like is there one kind of common failure
[[4118.56]]mode you see for people are that are
[[4122.32]]trying this and can't get it to work
[[4125.84]]yeah
[[4130.0]]so I will say that as a company also
[[4135.44]]we've we've grown and evolved then
[[4141.32]]companies that do want to help do want
[[4146.44]]our help we engage with them we we're
[[4151.4]]not like a Professional Services team
[[4155.64]]right we won't go and build a whole
[[4158.88]]solution but we're very very happy to
[[4163.72]]help and and uh consult people on their
[[4168.32]]journey and we've started doing that a
[[4171.92]]lot more now that we have more capacity
[[4178.4]]obviously in a team um
[[4185.72]]um I think what people really get wrong
[[4191.24]]is is cost estimations right I mean this
[[4196.72]]is one of those things that just you
[[4201.4]]know people come to me and like oh we
[[4205.84]]did the napkin math and like we would
[[4211.64]]pay you know $50,000 a month to Pine
[[4216.4]]Cone and that doesn't make sense to us
[[4219.8]]I'm like how did you compute that and
[[4224.16]]then they would tell you and you're like
[[4228.84]]oh my God like you know you just kind of
[[4234.4]]like just walk them through the the cost
[[4239.72]]calculators like 500 bucks a month I'm
[[4246.32]]like oh okay like great I'm really I'm
[[4252.24]]I'm really happy we had this
[[4256.72]]conversation right so yeah designing
[[4262.72]]their AI
[[4270.68]]solution even if it's it could like seem
[[4277.92]]like a small change but that might make
[[4283.52]]a huge difference in the cost of the
[[4289.12]]infrastructure and latencies and
[[4293.2]]freshness and a bunch of other stuff so
[[4296.88]]we're very happy to help with that
[[4300.8]]people get that wrong on a regular basis
[[4306.08]]and for me again as a technologist if
[[4311.52]]you use the wrong embedding models sure
[[4315.28]]your results might be slightly worse
[[4320.64]]slightly better you can fix that if you
[[4327.64]]calculated the costs and you now don't
[[4332.4]]embark on the journey because you
[[4336.4]]figured it was going to be too expensive
[[4340.8]]and that calculation was wrong you've
[[4345.88]]just like you're not even building
[[4350.84]]something that you should be
[[4355.44]]building uh and that for me is a is a
[[4362.32]]kind of sort of more final failure mode
[[4368.56]]which is much more painful and frankly
[[4373.16]]annoying because I you know I hear about
[[4377.48]]some of those things in hindsight well
[[4382.4]]some really large customer would say oh
[[4387.8]]we thought about you guys but then uh
[[4391.52]]like we figured we can't run this
[[4395.92]]project and then you're like W uh on the
[[4401.44]]cost side one thing that we see across a
[[4406.88]]lot of our infrastructure companies is
[[4413.48]]they ship an improvement that makes the
[[4418.76]]database or whatever it is is much more
[[4421.64]]efficient and then people actually end
[[4425.72]]up storing less or there's less compute
[[4431.12]]um or it cost customers less my guess is
[[4435.68]]with the serverless announcement that
[[4439.44]]customers could potentially be paying
[[4442.92]]you less than they otherwise would have
[[4446.08]]because you know they're now it's a
[[4449.32]]totally serverless model like was that
[[4453.12]]something uh what was it like shipping
[[4457.8]]that change and um you know ultimately
[[4463.12]]um the best thing for your customers but
[[4467.56]]uh potentially at the expense of some
[[4471.04]]short-term Revenue like how did how did
[[4474.88]]you think about um kind of moving to the
[[4479.72]]the serverless model no it's it's very
[[4484.68]]painful for us as a company and like for
[[4491.04]]Founders listening this is it's it's a
[[4498.68]]hard transition and you know for
[[4505.04]]investors to see your Revenue kind of go
[[4510.32]]up into the right in exactly the right
[[4514.76]]exponent and suddenly that thing
[[4518.64]]starting to flatten out and you tell
[[4522.92]]them hey look at workloads actually grow
[[4529.52]]faster now right but revenue is impacted
[[4535.28]]by the fact that our product is so much
[[4540.32]]cheaper now right um that is a
[[4545.68]]complicated discussion and that like you
[[4549.88]]know investors don't necessarily love to
[[4556.04]]see that and even though they sort of
[[4565.32]]like uh they understand it uh uh of
[[4573.28]]course they can rationalize it but they
[[4578.88]]still emotionally react badly to
[[4588.64]]it right uh my advice to Founders
[[4598.44]]is that kind of transition is much
[[4604.6]]easier done earlier than later uh and so
[[4609.84]]you should really move and do that as
[[4615.44]]fast as you can and take the hit as soon
[[4624.4]]as possible right um you know uh for
[[4632.84]]us we think we're leaving on the table
[[4638.52]]more than half of our revenue for some
[[4646.68]]of the customers is going to be uh 70 80
[[4655.76]]90% uh reduction in cost for extreme
[[4661.32]]cases in Pharma and others where the
[[4666.04]]workload is like super super super uh
[[4671.88]]like storage heavy this could be as as
[[4677.16]]little L one or two% of the spend like
[[4680.84]]we have companies they used to pay us
[[4685.52]]100K they now pay us $2,000 a month a
[[4690.4]]year sorry it's like literally almost
[[4695.24]]nothing right uh so they're very happy I
[[4699.92]]mean un investors are not very happy
[[4707.12]]about that but uh at the end of the day
[[4714.44]]it's
[[4718.16]]uh it's it's it's the right thing for
[[4721.88]]the customer and it's the right thing
[[4724.96]]for people
[[4728.76]]Building Solutions on top of our
[[4735.72]]platform and so if we can fit
[[4743.12]]really nicely into their own cost
[[4748.2]]structure of their own products we're
[[4752.84]]not going to be a part of the stack
[[4759.6]]right and you know when I think about
[[4766.92]]the trajectory of the
[[4771.8]]AI
[[4776.76]]stack we're really in the very first of
[[4781.64]]that like every
[[4786.4]]sign shows that the adoption curve is
[[4791.8]]such that like we're very early adopters
[[4798.32]]you know um you know
[[4804.8]]Trailblazers just getting to production
[[4809.48]]and so on at the end of the day like
[[4813.32]]almost every company is going to have a
[[4818.0]]vector base doing something either small
[[4822.2]]or medium or
[[4827.56]]large uh we're not there yet and so you
[[4833.6]]know if that's where we aim if we need
[[4837.92]]to fit snuggly into that cost structure
[[4843.04]]for like tens of thousands of or
[[4847.64]]hundreds of thousands of different
[[4851.96]]workloads we just have to do that even
[[4857.28]]you you know that there a lot of you
[[4864.28]]know pain uh in the medium term well
[[4870.0]]yeah one thing you know I I was struck
[[4873.04]]by as he he were kind of talking about
[[4876.44]]how we're in the early days of you know
[[4880.76]]AI infrastructure um you know a question
[[4884.96]]that every investor always and and folks
[[4888.16]]in the ecosystem are always asking is
[[4891.48]]what are kind of net new categories for
[[4895.6]]startups versus you know natural places
[[4899.88]]for comments to build product obviously
[[4903.48]]it seems like Factor databases have been
[[4906.32]]one of the space where there's been a
[[4909.04]]lot of net new companies you know
[[4912.4]]yourselves at the Forefront as you look
[[4916.04]]at the other parts of AI infrastructure
[[4919.2]]like what parts do you think make sense
[[4922.72]]for new players what parts are like the
[[4926.0]]existing infrastructure players going to
[[4928.92]]provide well uh Curious how you think
[[4932.92]]about that you know frankly I much more
[[4938.04]]excited about the application and the
[[4943.8]]the the solution space more than
[[4949.68]]the uh infrastructure layer right I mean
[[4956.88]]for new companies right this is uh
[[4963.92]]um in infrastructure there's a win or
[[4969.04]]take all
[[4973.04]]uh
[[4976.64]]uh you know
[[4981.4]]phenomenon that clearly works great for
[[4987.96]]us but but that also just means that the
[[4996.32]]you know the the uh where just the space
[[5004.44]]for for new companies is is very limited
[[5011.04]]right on the solution and application
[[5017.64]]side I think there is so much energy and
[[5024.16]]so much excitement and so many
[[5029.84]]different uh problems that can be solved
[[5034.6]]in Creative new ways
[[5041.68]]now that uh I frankly think
[[5051.28]]every you know every digital native
[[5059.2]]has uh whatever like 20 different
[[5065.72]]startups that like say now oh like we
[[5074.24]]are the new blah with AI right and uh
[[5081.48]]now they you know so you have 20
[[5087.88]]startups trying to uh usurp uh some some
[[5094.76]]some long-term player and you have that
[[5100.4]]long-term player trying to reassert
[[5107.32]]themselves as an AI uh Native
[[5113.52]]solution uh and at the same time you
[[5118.36]]have Enterprises both buying those
[[5122.52]]Technologies and learning how to use
[[5128.6]]them uh and so this it becomes like this
[[5135.64]]conveyor belt of innovation from Tiny
[[5140.96]]startups all the way down up to
[[5146.68]]Enterprises uh that is just teaming with
[[5153.28]]with Innovation and and great ideas and
[[5159.44]]a ton of value so I I you know again I
[[5165.44]]literally see hundreds of customers
[[5170.52]]hundreds of like
[[5175.68]]companies a week that that work with us
[[5181.52]]and so on and like each and every one of
[[5186.36]]them does something unique and
[[5190.08]]interesting and you're like holy [ __ ]
[[5193.56]]there's yet another application wow
[[5197.64]]there's more Val this I didn't think
[[5201.8]]about this okay amazing that's I guess
[[5207.44]]so wow what a fun kit right I mean I I
[[5212.36]]know you're an infrastructure guy but if
[[5216.16]]you uh if if you couldn't do ponco and
[[5220.6]]and had and were instead building an AI
[[5225.36]]application what would you build it's G
[[5232.64]]to sound uh weird to you but I I just
[[5241.56]]really love uh communication like like
[[5250.16]]uh email and slack and Twitter and like
[[5257.6]]I just love that kind of
[[5263.76]]data you know meetings re like
[[5270.48]]transcriptions and like conversations
[[5278.48]]and uh so there's something about human
[[5286.96]]communication written or spoken that
[[5295.36]]is uh I feel like just fascinating and
[[5301.84]]and and there's like a ton of knowledge
[[5307.2]]to be extracted it's all like super
[[5313.04]]Missy and exciting and complicated and
[[5318.24]]and very rich
[[5322.44]]and you know it will be something like
[[5327.2]]that whether it's medical records or
[[5335.04]]emails or jira tickets or what have you
[[5341.76]]like it would be something like that I
[[5344.36]]thought you were going to say something
[[5347.08]]around surfing but uh Communications
[[5351.64]]make sense too I wish I wish there was
[[5356.48]]like some yeah this I thought we were
[[5360.92]]limiting the scope to Ser to uh tech
[[5365.2]]companies if it was probably harder to
[[5369.64]]build a really strong software business
[[5372.8]]in
[[5375.52]]surfing I was like Wonder I was imag
[[5379.16]]like embeding surfing videos or
[[5382.92]]something you know for technique
[[5388.36]]coaching yeah could have a tech company
[[5393.84]]where I uh surf every day and then
[[5398.92]]pretend to have worked
[[5405.2]]uh on something techology there's
[[5410.24]]actually just an AI That's running the
[[5413.84]]whole time you're surfing there's an
[[5418.24]]agent that's doing all the work exactly
[[5422.44]]this is like my software company in the
[[5426.8]]Mal Dives on yeah I'm I'm honestly
[[5430.4]]convinced with some of Pat's
[[5432.84]]hallucinations that's what's happening
[[5437.8]]on uh on his end
[[5442.76]]I I guess you know also I mean you
[[5445.76]]obviously were were're previous lit to
[[5449.64]]you know interesting places I mean
[[5453.92]]curious like your reflection on on maybe
[[5457.16]]we'll go back to the most recent one in
[[5460.64]]Amazon like how do you kind of think
[[5464.32]]they're positioned right now what would
[[5467.8]]you be building if you were still there
[[5470.92]]uh obviously you did a lot of the
[[5474.52]]sagemaker work um any any Reflections on
[[5481.64]]that sure I you know I I look I mean
[[5489.6]]different companies just need to what
[[5495.48]]have the benefits and also like the
[[5500.68]]restriction of needing to focus on
[[5506.24]]different parts of the stack right uh
[[5511.4]]when you run at AWS scale if your
[[5515.36]]product doesn't bring in hundreds of
[[5520.84]]millions of dollars a year uh it's a
[[5526.32]]failed product it doesn't actually move
[[5531.4]]the needle at all right startups operate
[[5536.88]]in a different mode and so on and you
[[5541.12]]know your horizon for Innovation and
[[5545.04]]your appetite for risk is different and
[[5551.12]]so on so you know I don't know that
[[5558.56]]Amazon Frank L Google or Microsoft are
[[5564.72]]even working on the things that you know
[[5570.08]]we're working on uh I can tell you that
[[5576.28]]we are laser focused on stuff that we
[[5582.72]]know for a fact is going to be a part of
[[5588.12]]the stack and a part of the
[[5594.24]]solution uh and is realistically going
[[5600.92]]to hit the market in at least you know a
[[5606.32]]year and a half or two from now because
[[5611.16]]it's that early right in the same way
[[5616.52]]that you know five years ago we people
[[5620.4]]know didn't know what the hell we were
[[5624.56]]saying when we said Victor dat bases you
[[5629.52]]know we are now already working on the
[[5633.08]]stuff that's going to hit the market in
[[5636.32]]two or three years from now so that
[[5639.92]]that's that's that's the most exciting
[[5643.48]]thing for me to be honest I me this is
[[5648.24]]where like the really cool stuff is uh
[[5654.12]]kind of happens behind the scenes yeah
[[5658.76]]one thing that I think is interesting
[[5662.36]]especially around you know how company
[[5665.72]]how far in advance companies and
[[5668.76]]infrastructure companies like you guys
[[5673.6]]need to plan is you know being able to
[[5679.56]]skate to where the puck Puck is going
[[5684.16]]and you know kind of predict the future
[[5688.32]]in in some extent especially in a market
[[5691.92]]that is moving so fast where
[[5694.92]]infrastructure is changing really really
[[5698.64]]quickly and context windows are changing
[[5703.12]]what the models can do are changing Are
[[5708.6]]there specific kind of Technologies or
[[5714.36]]architectures or or maybe even companies
[[5718.08]]that you're watching and you're like
[[5720.56]]okay that is going to be a really big
[[5725.6]]thing in one year or in two years um or
[[5731.52]]anything like that that's on your radar
[[5735.24]]I think there's going to be a
[[5739.96]]significant ific an shift in the kinds
[[5746.72]]of Hardware that we use right what is
[[5753.52]]happening now with gpus I think
[[5759.92]]is not sustainable and it might still go
[[5765.36]]up before it goes down but I don't think
[[5769.0]]this
[[5774.72]]is uh what AI will look like going
[[5782.52]]forward right so that's that's on on
[[5788.44]]Hardware we're going to have to see some
[[5793.96]]something change there um and do you
[[5800.32]]think that means more CPU workloads or
[[5806.0]]people adapting models to run on CPUs or
[[5812.36]]or maybe it's something else it's um
[[5819.12]]it's going to be CPUs and gpus and maybe
[[5824.72]]specialized uh you know spec servers
[[5829.48]]that are really optimize for either
[[5832.8]]training or surveying or maybe
[[5836.92]]distributed infrastructure for that you
[[5841.4]]know I'm I'm sure Vector that Bas is are
[[5846.32]]going to pay a play a part in that but
[[5852.68]]it's it's not it's not even I'm not even
[[5857.76]]suggesting that right now it's really
[[5861.84]]just there has to be a change just like
[[5866.08]]microeconomic just doesn't make sense
[[5869.96]]what's happening now in terms of data
[[5874.92]]pipelines and and kind of data
[[5880.72]]management and and so on again
[[5885.36]]something's going to have to change it's
[[5889.56]]it's the tools that we
[[5895.28]]had 5 10 years ago just don't cut it
[[5901.52]]anymore uh and both the operational
[[5907.16]]headache and the actual costs and the
[[5911.76]]time they have to wait and so on are
[[5916.2]]just not reasonable something's going to
[[5921.72]]have to change there
[[5928.48]]um and again finally I I think we're
[[5934.36]]going to have to start seeing those
[[5939.72]]moderating systems where they even if
[[5945.76]]you don't own the model or whatever like
[[5951.96]]you have to somehow be able to have some
[[5958.12]]kind of governance and and visibility
[[5962.8]]and ability to control what's happening
[[5969.24]]with your stack that today runs open
[[5977.08]]loop for for most companies so we're
[[5982.32]]going to see I think meaningful changes
[[5987.52]]in the stack and in the in the software
[[5992.8]]we use for it I'm too intrigued by what
[[5995.92]]you said earlier about things you're
[[5998.6]]working on that you know will will blow
[[6001.56]]our minds in two three years all right I
[[6004.2]]don't know if we're allowed to ask but
[[6007.04]]I'll ask anyway any hints you can give
[[6010.36]]us on some of the research directions or
[[6013.96]]or where things are going in in your
[[6018.04]]world I
[[6023.0]]wish I had to I had to shamelessly uh
[[6027.36]]you know give it a go we'll we'll we'll
[[6030.32]]have to just reschedule you for 18
[[6033.2]]months from now so you can uh you can
[[6037.44]]announce it with us I promise I promise
[[6044.12]]uh to share we can be the VCS that uh
[[6049.96]]that then are saying wow you actually
[[6056.52]]said you actually did exactly what
[[6061.04]]do exactly um well you know we always
[[6065.56]]like to end our conversations with a
[[6068.52]]quick fire around where we get your
[[6071.76]]thoughts on on a set of common questions
[[6076.04]]we ask folks and so maybe to kick it off
[[6080.16]]would love your thoughts on one thing
[[6083.32]]that's overhyped and one thing that's
[[6087.48]]underhyped uh in AI today it's going to
[[6091.48]]sound nuts but I think foundational
[[6094.88]]model models are overhyped we know
[[6098.72]]exactly what they can and cannot do and
[[6102.24]]I don't think we're actually making a
[[6105.84]]lot of progress there to be honest for
[[6111.56]]quite a long time not any qualitative
[[6117.48]]progress I mean not any significant
[[6121.6]]progress you know I I don't know if it's
[[6125.88]]underhyped but I find the code
[[6132.0]]generation and and coding assistance to
[[6139.16]]be exceedingly useful it's one of
[[6145.84]]probably the most uh exciting use cases
[[6152.84]]of this technology so underhyped what's
[[6158.24]]been the biggest surprise in building
[[6161.52]]pine cone maybe something that you
[[6164.68]]thought would work but didn't or
[[6167.52]]something that you didn't think was
[[6170.56]]going to work that that ended up working
[[6176.76]]really well we had a at some point
[[6182.8]]pretty early I mean not very early on
[[6186.56]]maybe a year and a half into the
[[6191.24]]company maybe two I might be off but
[[6195.24]]what up a year and a half or two into
[[6199.48]]the life of the company we had a
[[6204.64]]complete rewrite of the entire database
[[6209.96]]in Rust everything from like we had C
[[6215.36]]and python go and control plan and this
[[6219.84]]that like a million different things and
[[6224.32]]we just we just rewrote everything in
[[6229.36]]Rust uh because we
[[6234.52]]figured like the kind of operational
[[6238.68]]issues that we were running into were
[[6241.4]]not going to be we're not going to be
[[6244.92]]able to scale with them I thought that
[[6249.8]]was like borderline suicide and it would
[[6255.08]]take us six months to even like get to
[[6259.44]]the point where we can
[[6264.12]]even you know be on par with our
[[6269.28]]existing system and at that point we'll
[[6276.4]]be far behind then our CTO Ram Shara was
[[6284.04]]you know I'm going to we're going to
[[6288.24]]we're going to complete this turn around
[[6293.52]]in like a month we're like no
[[6297.2]]way and uh I was shocked it didn't take
[[6303.08]]a month it took it took you know two
[[6309.16]]three months but you know the result was
[[6314.84]]so much better than than what we had
[[6319.48]]before that again like rewrites I don't
[[6323.6]]know if like anybody here whatever
[[6327.88]]rewrites are always like uh
[[6332.44]]like whatever this is like companies
[[6336.48]]literally die because of rewrites this
[[6341.72]]was like a huge bit uh and oftentimes
[[6346.52]]they just give you fresh and exciting
[[6350.04]]new problems often times worse than the
[[6353.84]]ones you started with this was one of
[[6358.16]]those like as advertised freites it
[[6362.76]]actually did what we were supposed to do
[[6367.04]]and I was just like holy [ __ ] it
[[6371.08]]actually
[[6376.32]]worked that's awesome um I guess besides
[[6381.08]]pine cone what other company do you
[[6384.88]]think would be most interesting to build
[[6389.0]]uh AI features at right now I would
[[6393.2]]probably go build like uh whatever join
[[6397.88]]either research lab or high performance
[[6402.96]]optimization like company that really
[[6411.8]]does sort of like uh compiling for for
[[6421.24]]these models I think the the fact that
[[6426.52]]the execution layer and the
[[6431.0]]training the software for training and
[[6436.28]]execution is one and the same is sort of
[[6440.36]]like
[[6444.4]]insane um so I think there's there's a
[[6449.68]]lot of fun engineering and science
[[6454.0]]problems to be solved there when do you
[[6458.48]]think we'll have agents that really work
[[6463.64]]don't they work already I mean to the
[[6468.88]]point where I can say hey AI agent book
[[6474.6]]me a trip or U something like that it I
[[6480.12]]don't know it seems like they sometimes
[[6485.28]]work but sometimes not so much well I
[[6489.4]]have human assistants that they they
[[6493.88]]don't work all the time either yeah I'm
[[6499.64]]not I'm not sure where you set the bar
[[6505.44]]on on how often they need to work as
[[6511.12]]much as like we expect from humans to
[[6516.28]]work they're already doing a decent job
[[6522.84]]I mean is it kind of I I will say that
[[6529.2]]when they make a mistake it's more
[[6534.0]]embarrassing like it's more like it's
[[6538.24]]it's silly because it's not a mistake a
[[6543.2]]human would make uh but I think just
[[6548.92]]like probability of completing the task
[[6553.16]]I think we're getting close to human
[[6557.0]]levels awesome well I feel like there's
[[6560.32]]a ton of threads in this conversation
[[6562.96]]that folks will want to turn on it's
[[6566.56]]been a fascinating discussion I'll leave
[[6570.36]]the word to you like where can folks go
[[6574.2]]to learn more about you about pine cone
[[6578.32]]uh feel free to to point folks in any
[[6582.76]]direction you want um look our website
[[6587.96]]is always a good place to start uh
[[6593.28]]there's plenty of material on how to
[[6599.88]]build stuff examples docks notebooks
[[6606.36]]like uh you know reference architectures
[[6611.64]]Integrations with partners and so on
[[6616.12]]yeah I mean it's always a good place to
[[6621.8]]start I I I will you know as as a meta
[[6628.44]]recommendation I would say don't don't
[[6633.2]]try to learn about pine cone try to go
[[6638.4]]build something exciting and if that
[[6644.44]]leads you to needing pine cone great and
[[6649.56]]if it doesn't great you still have you
[[6653.64]]know build something else that was
[[6658.64]]exciting nonetheless right but I think
[[6663.6]]like going back to the kind of somewhere
[[6667.32]]in the middle of our conversation the
[[6672.16]]most common mode of failure is doing
[[6679.0]]nothing uh and and you know if if you
[[6685.16]]can overcome that you've already like
[[6689.68]]outdone most most of the field right
[[6692.88]]then you just have to make sure you
[[6695.4]]don't do the cost estimate incorrectly
[[6699.64]]right yes correctly and then if you
[[6703.6]]think you're going to pay Pine on too
[[6707.68]]much uh drop us a line and we'll come
[[6711.96]]talk to
[[6715.52]]you amazing well you know this has been
[[6718.92]]a ton of fun seriously thank you so much
[[6722.48]]for coming on my pleasure
[[6727.0]]guys well Pat that was a that was a fun
[[6732.04]]one yeah super fun he's he's a really
[[6737.68]]interesting guest very thoughtful and
[[6743.16]]you know he kind of has this lens at the
[[6748.36]]infrastructure level but then they see
[[6752.88]]so much by virtue of everyone building
[[6756.88]]on top of pine cone so it was uh it was
[[6761.08]]cool to to hear his perspective yeah I
[[6764.36]]me what an interesting seat I feel like
[[6766.8]]he really does see everything right he
[[6769.68]]sees like the developers messing around
[[6773.0]]with new applications he sees the really
[[6776.2]]sophisticated Enterprises and what's
[[6780.76]]required for them to get rag live uh I
[[6785.44]]feel like it's a pretty cool uh cool
[[6789.4]]position to have yeah and he's even more
[[6793.36]]bullish on the applications and
[[6796.88]]infrastructure which I thought was funny
[[6800.36]]yeah I thought that was that was that
[[6804.44]]was interesting um and I loved the uh
[[6809.8]]the subtle JB at at VC's who you know uh
[[6814.84]]poo pooed vetro databases and then came
[[6818.92]]back in 2023 saying they had years of
[[6822.56]]conviction nothing nothing we would ever
[[6826.68]]do obviously yeah of course not us but
[[6830.24]]you know the other
[[6833.28]]VCS you know one thing that's just so
[[6836.6]]interesting about the space as a whole
[[6839.88]]is I feel like we've seen folks you know
[[6843.84]]pitching oh we have this sophisticated
[[6847.16]]embeddings model that works really well
[[6849.96]]in this context or this retrieval
[[6852.84]]approach and you know it's very clear
[[6855.12]]that we're still in such the early
[[6857.6]]Innings where it's just like folks are
[[6860.6]]just trying to find ways to make things
[[6864.04]]work the basics work and then you know
[[6867.76]]and I mean too's Point like you really
[[6871.16]]you just got to start building right and
[[6874.64]]I think if you can make the basics work
[[6878.32]]I I do wonder when we'll move to the
[[6882.08]]chapter of maybe more sophisticated
[[6885.8]]trade-offs and decisions around some of
[[6889.84]]these uh you know embeddings models and
[[6894.0]]approaches to retrieval but it certainly
[[6897.2]]seems like you know it was interesting
[[6901.32]]to hear him reiterate or reaffirm that
[[6906.12]]uh that yeah the case today is basically
[[6909.48]]just can can you get something up and
[[6913.08]]running and uh he just you know it's
[[6916.68]]clearly he's Blown Away by the stuff
[[6919.28]]that that folks have been able to get up
[[6922.96]]and running he's obviously biased given
[[6928.16]]where he sits as the CEO of DB company
[[6932.16]]but he
[[6936.04]]definitely believes that more of the
[[6940.32]]intelligence will move towards the
[[6944.64]]retrieval and you know towards that part
[[6949.0]]of the stack
[[6953.44]]versus purely at the kind of generation
[[6958.92]]and Andor model stage I loved his like
[[6963.32]]cynicism of like what a surprise the
[[6966.16]]people that charge per token have
[[6970.32]]increased the context
[[6973.28]]window you know I think he's the first
[[6976.12]]person we' ever had on that says
[[6979.4]]Foundation models were overhyped um you
[[6982.8]]know I don't know if he's not a scaling
[[6986.0]]laws believer or or or whatnot but it's
[[6991.0]]always fun to uh to to you know to to
[[6995.52]]get a I mean that's I think what's so
[[6998.88]]fun about the space is there's just you
[[7001.92]]know there's so many every time we do
[[7004.32]]overhype under hype there's like a
[[7007.76]]different set of things um whereas you
[[7011.88]]know uh as you know I run a healthcare
[[7015.08]]podcast and that space is a little bit
[[7018.4]]more stagnant it's like every time the
[[7021.76]]same things that are that are over and
[[7025.68]]underhyped yeah I I liked his underhyped
[[7031.52]]answer too of of coding assistant and
[[7036.44]]there's obviously a ton of hype around
[[7039.56]]them but I do think that is an
[[7044.0]]incredible application of AI and um uh
[[7048.76]]and one we're going to see a lot more of
[[7052.64]]um Shout Out pool side I guess ex
[[7055.88]]exactly always got to shout out the
[[7058.76]]portfolio I thought it was interesting
[[7062.76]]when he was talking about people not
[[7068.52]]defaulting to open AI um and you know
[[7075.0]]that is kind of the default now but he
[[7079.72]]sees smaller models that are potentially
[[7083.56]]cheaper doing just as well uh I thought
[[7087.24]]I thought that was interesting um
[[7090.56]]because I think that's that's not really
[[7094.64]]something that we see very much where it
[[7099.88]]kind of most people seem to start with
[[7105.64]]open AI or you know maybe draw whatever
[[7110.52]]and uh and then go from there totally I
[[7113.76]]mean I think he's laser focused on the
[[7117.72]]economics of of these use cases and you
[[7121.72]]know if I'm being honest I think a lot
[[7124.72]]of what we see today is still focus in
[[7128.12]]like this exploration mode where it's
[[7130.88]]like well what can you do with these
[[7133.16]]models and it's like you might as well
[[7136.4]]start with open AI because if you can't
[[7139.56]]do it with that you're not going to be
[[7142.88]]able to do it with with too much more uh
[[7148.12]]maybe a smaller fune model uh but I
[[7153.04]]think that you know it'll be interesting
[[7156.52]]to see one thing I'm super curious to
[[7160.08]]see is just will folks end up in this
[[7163.48]]kind of optimization phase as they
[[7167.0]]deploy this at SC scale probably but at
[[7170.24]]the same time right when you're ready to
[[7173.68]]optimize GT5 comes out or the next model
[[7177.2]]comes out and it's like you're you're
[[7179.92]]probably right back to just exploring
[[7183.16]]again like what are the capabilities
[[7186.56]]that you can do with these models and so
[[7190.48]]I do Wonder um I'm sure we'll see plenty
[[7194.88]]of cost optimization but uh this
[[7199.16]]exploration phase I think is going to be
[[7203.32]]continuous yeah he seemed a little bit
[[7209.28]]more bearish on scale than I think some
[[7216.4]]other folks in the ecosystem where we
[[7222.24]]hear a lot of bigger bigger more gpus
[[7226.0]]bigger models
[[7231.6]]all of this and you know his take
[[7238.96]]was it's not sustainable and the
[[7244.28]]Pendulum may swing back towards you know
[[7249.52]]CPUs and specialized hardware and
[[7253.88]]potentially specialized models and
[[7257.76]]smaller models and uh I thought I
[[7261.76]]thought that was pretty interesting well
[[7265.32]]Pat that was that was another fun one um
[[7269.04]]folks should definitely stay tuned uh
[[7272.84]]and like subscribe uh we are always
[[7276.48]]trying to get the word out um share with
[[7279.6]]a friend that you think might enjoy this
[[7282.48]]and stay tuned next week for another
[[7286.45]]great AI founder
