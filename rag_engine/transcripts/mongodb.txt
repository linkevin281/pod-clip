[[0]]welcome to the Logan Bartlett show on
[[3.04]]this episode what you're going here's a
[[6.4]]conversation I have with Dave aeria Dave
[[11.4]]is the president and CEO of mongod DB
[[16.04]]his third public company in this
[[19.72]]conversation Dave and I discussed the
[[23.92]]importance of hiring how to build an A+
[[28.48]]culture the power of self-awareness and
[[32.8]]Dave's take on artificial intelligence
[[36.72]]as well as the New York Tech scene a
[[40.72]]really fun conversation with one of the
[[45.48]]absolute best operators in Tech as a
[[50.32]]reminder we do not do advertising on the
[[54.48]]show but we would like for you to
[[58.32]]subscribe to to this on whatever channel
[[62.04]]that you're listening to us on now
[[65.46]]without further Ado here's
[[69.86]][Music]
[[75.2]]Dave Dave thanks for doing this my
[[79.84]]pleasure great to be here so I want to
[[83.64]]start out in the midpoint of I guess
[[87.24]]your professional career which is you
[[91.88]]taking the job at mongod DB so
[[97.12]]today it's a juggernaut I think everyone
[[101.16]]knows it in the public markets but at
[[105.8]]the time of you taking the job it wasn't
[[111.56]]quite the Juggernaut it is today um what
[[118.44]]did you see in the business at that time
[[124.92]]that made you say hey this is a job that
[[130.68]]I want to do well um first of all um
[[136.32]]whenever you get a call for a CEO role
[[140.36]]the first question I you know trained
[[143.68]]myself to ask is what's wrong because no
[[146.68]]one makes coo change with things are
[[150.04]]going perfectly well and there were
[[154.52]]number you know when you uh help help uh
[[158.68]]you know have a successful outcome and
[[161.8]]make investors money invariably you get
[[165.96]]called for other roles and uh I
[[170.16]]typically said no to a bunch of them
[[173.88]]because PRS were quite endemic and the
[[177.16]]companies that they had as me to
[[181.16]]consider leading um I had been a VC for
[[186.72]]a while for a couple years um and I had
[[190.88]]looked at the Next Generation database
[[193.48]]space and actually I looked at some
[[197.6]]competing Investments to Mong B I ended
[[201.92]]up passing those Investments because
[[204.68]]when I did my diligence and again this
[[208.76]]is a lot smaller scale mongodb still
[[213.12]]seemed ahead of everyone else in terms
[[217.0]]of developer me momentum mind share and
[[221.72]]even commercial traction so when I got
[[226.24]]the call I was intrigued and frankly one
[[229.32]]of the questions I thought to myself
[[232.08]]maybe I have a chance to invest in
[[235.88]]mongodb and then when I met with with
[[239.88]]the uh board and some members of the
[[244.48]]executive team and the founders um what
[[250.64]]I saw was uh that uh the product team
[[256.4]]was in pretty good shape but I was
[[261.36]]dismayed at uh their goto Market efforts
[[265.36]]and was a little underwhelmed with the
[[268.72]]leadership that was in place and I
[[272.2]]thought to myself normally that would
[[275.32]]scare people but I thought to myself if
[[279.28]]this company is the head of the pack and
[[284.12]]it's clearly got at best a B Team
[[289.32]]imagine what would happen if an A Team
[[294.2]]came in and so as I thought about that I
[[298.44]]got more and more conviction and I
[[302.64]]decided to take the role and uh that's
[[307.12]]why I ended up here when you came in you
[[312.4]]can't do it all at once you can't change
[[317.72]]everything uh the second you come in
[[321.88]]what were the first things that you went
[[325.6]]about changing yeah that's a really good
[[329.16]]point because anyone is trying to be a
[[333.6]]change agent you can't um try and fix
[[337.96]]everything all at once because you'll
[[341.64]]just fail so you have to sequence things
[[344.96]]in terms of what you need to fix Now
[[348.6]]versus later so I took the approach of
[[352.44]]starting with a customer and working
[[356.2]]backwards into the core product um
[[360.28]]because I Minds told me that the go to
[[365.6]]market organization was not very good um
[[371.04]]and kindly quite dysfunctional I
[[375.08]]remember I hadn't actually started and I
[[378.6]]got a call saying hey we have this
[[382.52]]important meeting with a with a customer
[[387.52]]a senior executive at Verizon and so I
[[391.56]]said would you mind taking a you know a
[[394.52]]call because they're trying to set you
[[397.08]]up when you join to meet with this
[[400.92]]customer so sure I happy to and so I'm
[[406.68]]on the a call with this account team and
[[411.96]]I could tell like uh the account team
[[415.88]]didn't really the leader of the team
[[418.84]]didn't really have all the facts so I've
[[421.68]]starting to ask the rep more and more
[[425.44]]specific questions and finally I asked
[[429.28]]the rep so where are you based I said
[[432.28]]maybe you know we can just meet for
[[435.44]]coffee just to get a little more detail
[[438.32]]just so I could have a one-onone
[[441.28]]conversation with him and he said he's
[[446.64]]based in Atlanta I said how can a rep
[[451.8]]who's covering Verizon be based in
[[456.52]]Atlanta so that was one of many examples
[[461.24]]of of what I saw so was some of the
[[465.96]]dysfunction at mang DB so I started
[[470.76]]basically working from the customer
[[475.64]]backwards and I said as I fix the go to
[[480.0]]market and in particular sales
[[483.32]]organization then the Fidelity of the
[[487.32]]feedback I get on product will be that
[[490.76]]much more clear then I'll know what
[[493.68]]exactly I need to fix on the product
[[498.12]]side so me methodically we basically
[[502.72]]actually in my first 90 days we did a
[[506.96]]big rip of a bunch of the salespeople
[[512.0]]because they just weren't very good uh
[[517.08]]and the track record also showed that uh
[[521.84]]then I brought in a new cro I brought a
[[527.16]]new CMO and then nine months later after
[[532.32]]I started I brought a new CFO so the
[[536.76]]core Atomic unit of the product was
[[541.92]]mostly working well and you had to make
[[546.84]]some changes along the way to make sure
[[550.92]]the product had the right Fidelity yeah
[[555.36]]so what we realized um and I and I knew
[[559.36]]this going in was that the read
[[562.44]]performance for mang was very good but
[[565.44]]there were some limitations on write
[[568.28]]performance or people weren't really
[[572.04]]comfortable for using a MDB for right
[[576.08]]intensive use cases and we had to fix
[[580.4]]that and the product teams and
[[584.12]]Engineering teams were working on
[[586.76]]rewriting our storage engine but that
[[590.56]]was a pretty big lift and in the middle
[[595.44]]of this we got to meet the wire tiger
[[600.04]]team which is a bunch of X Berkeley DB
[[604.32]]guys who were very very
[[609.52]]sophisticated um uh database Architects
[[614.96]]and Engineers who had 20 plus years in
[[619.96]]the industry and they had actually had a
[[624.28]]storage engine that was optimized for
[[628.4]]both read and write performance and so
[[632.32]]we got very excited and we were actually
[[635.36]]worried because some of the customers
[[639.72]]included AWS and and a few other larger
[[645.48]]you know uh organizations so we were
[[651.24]]nervous that that technology and that
[[656.2]]team could be acquired on under our feet
[[660.84]]and so we moved pretty quickly the
[[664.64]]company didn't have a tremendous amount
[[667.6]]of cash you know even though it raised a
[[670.36]]lot of capital burned through a lot of
[[673.28]]capital so we also had to do a a
[[677.2]]financing at the same time to fund that
[[681.24]]acquisition uh but we were able to pull
[[685.48]]that off and then the wire tiger storage
[[689.52]]engine became the core storage engine
[[692.88]]for the product which enabled us to
[[697.0]]really broaden our use case and you know
[[701.24]]be on the march to be a general purpose
[[707.16]]platform so this was 2014 2014 2015 and
[[714.92]]and so you're making plans to go public
[[720.76]]around this time yet no when I came into
[[725.68]]the business um the company had raised
[[729.72]]was actually one of the first unicorns
[[733.96]]when unicorns were actually rare and uh
[[739.16]]but that um fund raise was underwritten
[[743.24]]by a very aggressive operating plan it
[[746.48]]was clear that the company had no chance
[[749.44]]of hitting it which is why the board
[[752.92]]decided to make a CO change and you
[[758.12]]reset the plan when you came in yes and
[[763.28]]for people again who are change agents
[[766.52]]one of the things I also think is very
[[768.76]]important for people to feel like
[[772.64]]they're winning and the plan was just so
[[778.12]]uh uh unattainable the worst thing you
[[782.72]]can do is you know keep feeling like
[[786.4]]you're failing so I went to the board
[[789.6]]and said this plan is not realistic
[[793.56]]obviously had the benefit of of not the
[[797.92]]one who actually wrote the original plan
[[801.12]]and I went back to them and said here's
[[804.6]]what I think is a more realistic plan
[[809.88]]the board in their wisdom agreed and
[[814.96]]then once you have a new plan and then
[[818.28]]you start beating your numbers all of a
[[820.96]]sudden you know you start people feeling
[[824.08]]like they have their Mojo suddenly they
[[827.04]]feel like they're winners again and you
[[830.28]]just start building morale and momentum
[[833.92]]in the business so when you joined how
[[837.0]]many people were there there there was
[[840.28]]roughly about 350 people and then with
[[843.76]]the rift we went down to about 250
[[847.2]]people wow so so laid off about 100
[[851.84]]people to come in and then slowly built
[[858.0]]back up over the course of uh what how
[[863.0]]long did it take you to get back to 350
[[866.4]]people or so uh I don't remember exactly
[[870.28]]but my philosophy in the first phase was
[[874.12]]just we just had to get our go to market
[[877.36]]execution sound we had to be able to you
[[880.56]]know do what we say and say what we do
[[883.36]]we had to be able to forecast the
[[886.92]]business be able to then meet and exceed
[[892.32]]those forecasts we had to rebuild how we
[[898.16]]actually prosecuted deals you know
[[902.32]]you've talked to John McMahon about the
[[906.48]]whole you know sales process at blade
[[910.52]]logic so I had a lot of experience in
[[914.52]]that way the first cro was an XL logic
[[919.72]]PTC guy named Carlos delatori who helped
[[924.76]]me kind of really restructure and put
[[930.08]]the basic foundations in place and then
[[934.72]]lo and behold the business started you
[[938.48]]know growing very quickly one of the
[[943.44]]knocks on open source up until that
[[948.08]]point was that it was very difficult to
[[951.48]]monetize Red Hat had been the one that
[[955.88]]had been able to make it and become a
[[960.12]]big public company but there there
[[964.48]]weren't a Litany of examples of Open
[[968.6]]Source companies in the public markets
[[972.4]]that I've been able to successfully
[[976.96]]scale in a meaningful way how did you
[[981.44]]think about that the the trade-off
[[985.32]]between the ability to monetize the
[[988.52]]community all of that stuff when you
[[991.92]]came in it's a great question and
[[995.56]]frankly when I told my friends and
[[998.88]]people I trusted I was contemplating
[[1001.8]]taking this job they thought I was crazy
[[1004.6]]they said first a database company in
[[1007.88]]New York that's crazy when was the last
[[1011.12]]database company that we up up before
[[1015.0]]you it was 25 years 25 years ago yeah
[[1020.32]]the second thing was like a um open
[[1024.8]]source like this you know who's made
[[1028.52]]money in open source and then just a
[[1032.44]]database space itself forget about New
[[1036.32]]York there was a lot of you know next
[[1039.88]]Generation database companies that died
[[1043.48]]on the vine trying to be the next big
[[1047.84]]Oracle killer so all the kind of
[[1051.56]]conventional wisdom was against that and
[[1054.48]]the big one what I worried about was how
[[1057.56]]do we monetize open source because the
[[1060.8]]traditional open source model is you
[[1064.04]]have to define the pay wall between
[[1067.64]]what's free and what's paid for and to
[[1071.12]]some degree it's a thousan bargain
[[1074.4]]because if you give away a lot of
[[1078.04]]features to drive adoption it's very
[[1081.96]]hard to monetize and if you don't give
[[1086.0]]away enough features then you don't have
[[1089.28]]a lot of adoption so there's not a lot
[[1092.48]]of install base to then go monetized so
[[1096.44]]you're kind of Trapped In in this fan
[[1100.76]]bargain one of the things I realized in
[[1105.64]]actually watching AWS is that they were
[[1110.72]]monetizing open source as a service
[[1114.52]]really really well because you're no
[[1117.92]]longer defining a particular pay you're
[[1122.32]]defining monetization based on usage so
[[1126.2]]that fundamentally changed the Paradigm
[[1129.52]]about how open source technology was to
[[1134.04]]be used and so essentially we
[[1138.68]]recognizing that that had to be our
[[1142.8]]long-term future but you just couldn't
[[1146.76]]go there overnight now luckily we had
[[1150.04]]been investing in management tools
[[1152.76]]because that was the existing way we
[[1155.84]]were monetizing the technology whatever
[[1158.84]]the developer needed to build
[[1161.96]]applications was free but whatever you
[[1165.56]]needed to kind of mon you know Monitor
[[1169.24]]and manage and backup your
[[1173.2]]infrastructure was paid for so we were
[[1177.24]]starting to build tools which end up
[[1180.92]]being the ingredients for how we
[[1184.28]]actually rolled out our cloud service
[[1188.32]]what came first uh Atlas or the
[[1193.72]]license change M DB Atlas DB Atlas
[[1198.72]]so can you talk a little bit about that
[[1203.16]]you guys were one of the pioneers and
[[1207.8]]coming out with a cloud first kind of
[[1213.0]]open core model around that right yes uh
[[1218.16]]this was pre- snowflake being popular
[[1222.52]]pre-confluent pre- elastic pre- a bunch
[[1226.08]]of other companies roll trying to roll
[[1228.56]]out cloud services a lot of people
[[1230.84]]thought were crazy a lot of people
[[1232.96]]thought how is it that you're going to
[[1236.68]]partner and compete with hyperscalers
[[1240.36]]because we just didn't have the capital
[[1243.08]]go build our own data centers and then
[[1246.32]]trying to get all developers to come to
[[1249.48]]us we had to leverage the existing
[[1252.92]]infrastructure that the hyperscalers
[[1256.84]]have built but they also offer their own
[[1260.56]]competitive database offerings so a lot
[[1264.36]]of people are incredibly skeptical one
[[1267.96]]of the things that changed with rolling
[[1271.08]]out a cloud service is that we felt we
[[1274.24]]were really talking to the people who
[[1277.72]]loved our product because the existing
[[1281.12]]monetization model was while the
[[1284.4]]developers adopted mongodb the people
[[1289.48]]who bought our proprietary uh software
[[1294.04]]were the Ops folks because they were
[[1297.92]]trying to solve devops problem they
[[1302.08]]really viewed mongodb as a relationship
[[1305.16]]with convenience developers had a
[[1309.08]]relationship of love so for them it was
[[1313.52]]just H I guess if we have to deploy mang
[[1317.16]]I should buy your tools so it's always a
[[1321.32]]very painful uh engagement with the
[[1325.6]]customer but once you start dealing with
[[1328.88]]the development teams and saying you
[[1331.88]]know you can get out of the a world of
[[1334.84]]all this undifferentiated labor you
[[1337.8]]don't have to worry about provisioning
[[1341.52]]configuring and managing and backing up
[[1345.08]]your infrastructure we'll take care of
[[1348.44]]all that for you all you can focus on is
[[1352.0]]what really is Meaningful to your
[[1355.16]]business is building amazing apps that
[[1358.72]]transform your business that suddenly
[[1363.48]]got people's attention and so what was
[[1368.04]]also interesting is the launch of Atlas
[[1371.4]]forced us to build a self serve business
[[1374.6]]because initially we you know only
[[1378.8]]offered on sell serve where we basically
[[1382.88]]you know with a credit card you could go
[[1386.92]]provision in a cluster at first AWS then
[[1391.36]]we rolled out it rolled it out to gcp
[[1396.08]]and Azure and that also enabled us to
[[1400.68]]start acquiring customers in a much more
[[1405.44]]frictional way and even today when you
[[1410.36]]look at the atlas business the majority
[[1414.0]]of our customers are quote unquote sales
[[1418.4]]sold but the origin of those customers
[[1422.96]]the majority of which are still s serve
[[1426.64]]and that's a very interesting Dynamic
[[1430.24]]and in some ways a virtuous circle what
[[1433.6]]was the hardest part about getting that
[[1437.4]]going was it was it the getting the
[[1442.12]]sales reps to to sell the product was it
[[1446.08]]figuring out the pricing model was it
[[1449.64]]actually building the product itself to
[[1453.48]]service it the way we framed it was
[[1457.12]]building a startup with the startup and
[[1461.4]]then we were very emphatic that this we
[[1466.84]]could not fail and so from the board on
[[1472.08]]down this was like a very viewed as a
[[1476.4]]very strategic imperative and one of the
[[1479.52]]challenges when you're starting
[[1482.28]]something small you know when we went
[[1485.88]]public atas was like one or two% of our
[[1489.52]]business so the numbers really didn't
[[1493.28]]matter that much right so consequently
[[1497.28]]it's very easy to ignore this little
[[1500.6]]thing you're trying to do when you focus
[[1503.68]]on the core business so one of the other
[[1507.28]]things I did was I disproportionately
[[1511.72]]incentivized the exact team on the
[[1516.68]]performance of Atlas business uh
[[1520.92]]disproportionately to the scale of the
[[1524.0]]atlas business because it was so
[[1526.4]]important to make sure that they had
[[1529.6]]mind share the other thing that we also
[[1532.96]]really focused on was having a clear
[[1536.44]]single threaded leader who was now was a
[[1540.16]]guy named sahir ozam was now a chief
[[1543.72]]product officer he had this unique
[[1547.76]]ability of being very good on the
[[1552.16]]product and Technology side but also
[[1556.2]]really good in front of customers and
[[1559.56]]and kind of knew how to preach the
[[1563.76]]gospel of Alice and changing behavior is
[[1568.28]]hard and looking back now it says wow
[[1572.24]]this end up being a great success but
[[1575.84]]like any success story when you zoom
[[1579.32]]into the up into the right line there's
[[1583.64]]a lot of jagged edges and in getting the
[[1587.76]]Salesforce to change Behavior because
[[1591.68]]they they knew how to sell the on-prem
[[1596.36]]product and recognizing that your
[[1600.4]]primary customer is no longer the Ops
[[1604.0]]person but now it's the development team
[[1607.36]]getting to understand you have to sell
[[1611.52]]the total cost of ownership that um
[[1615.76]]getting to understand what is the true
[[1619.4]]value proposition of a cloud service
[[1623.76]]takes time and you just got to be you
[[1628.52]]know maniacal about that execution and
[[1634.36]]just constantly train and enable U the
[[1639.44]]Salesforce to do that and that takes
[[1642.56]]that that just didn't happen overnight
[[1645.72]]so we start with C serve then we
[[1649.48]]migrated to kind of the SB space and
[[1654.0]]high-tech organizations who were more
[[1658.88]]inclined to use Atlas and then later we
[[1663.0]]went into the high end of the Enterprise
[[1667.24]]segment were you spiffing the Reps
[[1671.4]]because I assume the dollars between
[[1675.32]]each the long-term of Cloud Atlas and
[[1678.92]]obviously the equity value it's created
[[1682.48]]has been pretty significant but the
[[1687.2]]dollars UPF front of selling on
[[1691.72]]Prem I assume had to be more is that how
[[1695.28]]you kind of did the incentive alignment
[[1698.56]]um it was similar in the early days
[[1702.0]]because we paid sales people on
[[1706.64]]commitments on ACV uh but but over time
[[1711.12]]we realized that was a mistake with a
[[1714.68]]cloud business because a lot of the apps
[[1719.2]]being rolled on Atlas were new apps and
[[1723.4]]so customer didn't really know how much
[[1726.48]]would the consumption be how big would
[[1729.72]]the app grow how many users would it
[[1733.8]]have how much data would be consumed and
[[1738.56]]so there's this lot of friction to force
[[1742.92]]a customer to Comm into a commitment
[[1747.48]]prematurely so over time we changed
[[1753.12]]incentives to encourage um customers
[[1758.52]]just to get on Atlas and then once they
[[1762.88]]felt like they had Clarity on the growth
[[1766.36]]projectory then they could come back and
[[1769.16]]get a better discount based on some
[[1771.96]]volume commitment and we've constantly
[[1775.6]]iterated on that you know sales
[[1780.28]]incentive in fact now over the last four
[[1785.48]]or five years has changed all the way to
[[1790.36]]where we're all in on consumption but it
[[1795.44]]started by a more traditional incentive
[[1800.28]]mindset were you worried at all about
[[1804.68]]cannibalizing the existing business or
[[1808.4]]was it clear that this is just going to
[[1811.28]]be the long-term future when you came in
[[1814.04]]there was a little bit of worry but it
[[1816.76]]was clear like our business wasn't that
[[1819.56]]big that we had this like large
[[1822.28]]installed base I mean remember I joined
[[1824.92]]the company when there was about 30
[[1828.44]]million Revenue when we filed our S1 we
[[1832.64]]were doing a little over 100 million
[[1836.92]]revenue and so it was not a huge
[[1841.44]]business and obviously today now we're
[[1845.44]]roughly about a$ 1.7 billion run rate
[[1849.44]]that's wild now now the other big change
[[1852.84]]I think that was notable that you guys
[[1856.4]]helped High year was a license shift and
[[1860.96]]so for people that aren't uh nerds in
[[1865.68]]the open source uh world can you maybe
[[1870.36]]talk through the difference between agpl
[[1876.0]]and sspl and what was a fairly
[[1881.96]]controversial decision at at the time
[[1886.48]]and how you went about making that right
[[1890.76]]so um when you looked at what the cloud
[[1895.28]]providers were doing um what what they
[[1899.04]]were doing was basically taking the free
[[1903.28]]versions of very popular open source
[[1908.84]]projects MySQL and a bunch of other
[[1914.36]]examp postgress Etc and basically
[[1918.52]]plugging those Technologies into their
[[1922.08]]cloud and offering as a service and they
[[1926.0]]were making money Handover fist this is
[[1930.24]]Amazon and Microsoft and Google and all
[[1935.6]]them are correct and so um what we were
[[1940.56]]concerned about was that the the
[[1944.52]]hyperscalers or someone else might do
[[1948.16]]the same with us what what people in the
[[1953.04]]industry call strip mining and agpl has
[[1957.32]]more
[[1960.92]]restrictions uh than say GPL or the
[[1966.44]]Apache license but there's still some
[[1971.12]]ambiguity in the language and what we
[[1974.92]]said is we' got the sense is as our
[[1979.32]]success started to take off we got the
[[1982.92]]sense you know what someone's going to
[[1988.4]]try and test how how um strictest
[[1994.76]]licenses and we didn't want to find
[[1998.92]]ourselves litigating this in court so we
[[2002.64]]made the decision that we need to come
[[2006.4]]out with our own proprietary license
[[2010.36]]which adhered to all the principles of
[[2014.2]]Open Source you know you can have access
[[2017.88]]to the source code you could modify the
[[2021.6]]code you could obviously distribute the
[[2026.48]]code but what you couldn't do or if you
[[2031.28]]decided to do was to offer mongodb as a
[[2035.2]]service you you had to open source all
[[2038.64]]the extensions you made to mongodb as
[[2041.56]]well as all the underline infrastructure
[[2044.72]]to offer that service and we said that
[[2048.32]]seems very reasonable because if you
[[2051.44]]choose to do that you just need to give
[[2055.36]]it back to the community it was candidly
[[2060.32]]a quite a contentious discussion we
[[2064.88]]tried to socialize this and get the OSI
[[2068.96]]which was the body that approves open
[[2072.6]]source licenses and they were up in arms
[[2076.84]]and said we don't this is not real open
[[2081.08]]source and a lot of people said oh my
[[2084.68]]God we might risk our adoption because
[[2089.32]]mangadu is quite popular and U our
[[2093.64]]adoption might dry out because people
[[2096.76]]will not want to use the non-sanctioned
[[2101.36]]open- source product and I thought about
[[2106.68]]this problem and I thought to myself if
[[2111.84]]you're a developer in Shanghai or Mumbai
[[2118.44]]or Pao Alto or New York yes so long as
[[2124.24]]it you know has remained consistent to
[[2127.76]]the open source principles are you
[[2130.68]]really going to care that much whether
[[2134.36]]or not it's an OSI sanction license
[[2138.8]]versus a license that enables you to do
[[2142.76]]what you want to do but more importantly
[[2146.12]]the product is the best product to solve
[[2148.64]]the problem that you're trying to
[[2152.4]]address and the BET was that develop ERS
[[2157.44]]wouldn't care about this and uh and
[[2161.24]]ultimately that bet that paid off but
[[2164.0]]there were definitely some nashing of
[[2167.4]]teeth when we made that decision and now
[[2171.52]]a lot of people have followed suit or
[[2176.68]]other people's using actually L people
[[2182.28]]have used SSP there's a dur called BSL
[[2186.32]]which kind of was inspiration based on
[[2190.12]]SSL where there's more protections
[[2194.28]]around people strip mining open source
[[2198.04]]technology which is basically I mean one
[[2202.72]]of the beauties of Open Source is uh is
[[2207.24]]that it allows for distribution it
[[2210.24]]allows people to use it for their own
[[2213.44]]intent if they want to service they want
[[2217.48]]to use it how however they see fit but
[[2221.88]]if you want to commercially use the
[[2225.56]]product you have to be willing to give
[[2229.4]]back and so the the the only people this
[[2233.52]]is really hurting I think are the big
[[2236.96]]cloud providers that are trying to offer
[[2240.04]]it as their own is that fair or or
[[2242.76]]Regional Cloud providers who also want
[[2246.2]]to do something like that yeah and our
[[2249.92]]belief was that when you think about
[[2252.6]]what's important for the end user the
[[2255.36]]end users are not going to care so it's
[[2258.88]]only people who have um mercenary
[[2262.08]]interests are going to you know be
[[2265.04]]annoyed about this so so that that
[[2268.92]]doesn't bother us and what you know the
[[2272.88]]whole strategy was we want to benefit
[[2277.04]]from the virality and the distribution
[[2282.12]]of Open Source while building a moat
[[2286.36]]like a typical software company and
[[2289.44]]that's essentially what's our strategy
[[2293.28]]and ultimately that strategy has paid
[[2297.72]]off and this has allowed a lot of Open
[[2302.44]]Source open core businesses to now
[[2307.2]]actually monetize and be able to build
[[2311.12]]themselves into big companies as well
[[2314.8]]exactly owners shift gears a little bit
[[2318.6]]is this your third or fourth company as
[[2322.76]]CEO third third company as CEO third
[[2327.0]]public company as well right what do you
[[2331.28]]view as the job of the CEO um I think
[[2334.76]]there's different definitions for
[[2337.88]]different types of cosos U in my
[[2342.84]]definition and I'll give Mark mlin from
[[2348.16]]uh the Old Co at paal networks he kind
[[2353.28]]of informed my my thinking around what a
[[2358.6]]CO should do and the basic point is that
[[2362.56]]I can do a thousand things like I can do
[[2366.04]]this podcast I you know I do a lot of
[[2370.36]]customer meetings I do a lot of employee
[[2374.8]]meetings I do review cor have corly
[[2379.8]]review sessions and qbrs to reviews to
[[2385.36]]attend sales forecast reviews Etc but if
[[2390.72]]I don't do three things well and I do
[[2396.28]]another 997 things well I failed and
[[2400.88]]what are those three things first what
[[2404.44]]is a company strategy what are we trying
[[2408.2]]to do where are we trying to go and how
[[2412.36]]are we trying to get there two do I have
[[2416.36]]the right people especially at the
[[2420.2]]executive level to go execute on that
[[2425.72]]strategy and three um have I removed all
[[2431.6]]the obstacles whether it's resourcing
[[2436.0]]whether it's culture whether it's
[[2439.72]]organizational alignment to make sure
[[2443.0]]that we can actually are set up for
[[2446.56]]Success so I can do all those other
[[2450.12]]things but I don't do those three things
[[2454.28]]well in my mind I failed and so to me
[[2458.6]]that's essentially what I think is
[[2462.44]]intrinsic to my job at some level being
[[2467.16]]CEO also means being like a super head
[[2472.0]]of HR and recruiting talent and being
[[2476.08]]able to get people within the Y how do
[[2481.56]]you think about uh that and and managing
[[2488.04]]a team as a core component well I tell
[[2493.76]]my team and I tell actually um everyone
[[2498.16]]in the company we're not in the database
[[2500.92]]business we're not software business
[[2503.64]]we're in the people business because
[[2507.32]]people are the means to uh to an end to
[[2511.96]]everything and invariably all the the
[[2515.68]]issues we're dealing with you know
[[2519.0]]what's going well what's going sideways
[[2523.16]]what's going really poorly is all tied
[[2527.48]]to people in fact I had an offsite with
[[2531.2]]the leadership team a couple weeks ago
[[2534.68]]and I I did a review of all the projects
[[2538.24]]that we've done really well and all the
[[2541.68]]projects that have struggled and what
[[2545.64]]was the root cause of those is that we
[[2550.24]]didn't have what we call the right dri
[[2554.76]]the directly responsible individual who
[[2558.6]]had the skills and experience to either
[[2563.08]]lead those projects or in some cases it
[[2567.88]]wasn't clear who the drri was so there
[[2572.72]]were shared accountability and Jeff bzo
[[2576.96]]says if you want something to something
[[2580.36]]to fail make it their part-time job and
[[2584.8]]so to me having the right people in the
[[2588.88]]right roles is so critical to everything
[[2592.0]]and so a lot of people and a lot of
[[2595.96]]organizations have this aspiration I
[[2601.12]]want to do X I want to go y That's the
[[2605.76]]easy part it's the day and day out
[[2610.2]]blocking and tackling of you know having
[[2614.52]]the right team focusing on what good
[[2619.2]]looks like measuring progress inspecting
[[2624.12]]deeply on how things are going well
[[2628.4]]identifying issues whether people issues
[[2634.0]]alignment issues um other problems and
[[2639.64]]just you know doing that day in and day
[[2643.36]]out is what really differentiates
[[2646.2]]companies that execute well versus
[[2649.64]]companies who aspired to execute well
[[2653.76]]but just don't so every strategic
[[2657.64]]initiative you guys have internally has
[[2661.88]]a dri that's responsible and accountable
[[2666.6]]for it yes and and that's a hot button
[[2670.52]]for me I mean there's times when it's
[[2673.92]]not clear and we say we need to have
[[2677.44]]identify the right drri so that'll be
[[2682.08]]like step one and the the role of drri
[[2687.92]]is to Define ID I IE what is good look
[[2693.04]]like and what time frame uh what is a
[[2697.52]]plan to get there and then what are how
[[2701.56]]do we measure progress and then
[[2705.44]]ultimately that person or that
[[2709.24]]Associated team will then come and
[[2712.96]]report if it's an important initiative
[[2716.6]]that will come and report to me and the
[[2720.16]]exact team on on progress and I would
[[2723.6]]kindly say we've done those some of
[[2726.76]]those really well and some of those have
[[2729.68]]been a little halfhazard and we're
[[2732.96]]trying to sharpen our execution there to
[[2736.8]]become even better I've heard you say
[[2741.12]]early in your career that you viewed uh
[[2745.8]]you didn't view vulnerability as a
[[2750.48]]strength uh but now it's it's become
[[2754.68]]something that that you're you're
[[2758.24]]proactive about and being willing to say
[[2761.6]]that you don't know the answer to
[[2764.64]]something when when that's the case can
[[2767.8]]you talk a little bit about that yeah I
[[2770.56]]think uh for people listening you
[[2772.88]]probably have a lot of Founders and
[[2775.44]]first-time cosos who are listening to
[[2778.88]]this podcast and I can tell you that
[[2783.36]]most people go through massive imposter
[[2787.8]]syndrome you know the investors wi than
[[2791.96]]the money now there's a team in place
[[2796.48]]and you're like holy you know this
[[2800.8]]is real and if you've never done it
[[2804.36]]before this it's not like you can
[[2807.44]]suddenly like suddenly magically learn
[[2811.16]]everything overnight and so when I was a
[[2815.52]]first first time Co I felt this enormous
[[2820.52]]pressure to be the all knowing on every
[[2824.76]]facet of the business whether it's
[[2831.04]]product marketing sales Finance Etc and
[[2837.96]]over time I realized I was really
[[2841.64]]frustrating my team because I felt like
[[2844.52]]I had to have my imprint on every
[[2847.76]]decision and I would micromanage some
[[2851.88]]decisions or I'd come in over the top
[[2856.2]]and claim credit to decisions that other
[[2860.12]]people had already come up with and it
[[2863.44]]was getting to be dysfunctional I could
[[2866.32]]sense that I was not being very
[[2868.68]]effective I could sense I was
[[2871.32]]frustrating my team and I had an
[[2875.04]]epiphany one day and said I don't need
[[2879.36]]to have all the answers what I need to
[[2883.68]]do is one have the right people around
[[2888.0]]me and be able to ask good questions and
[[2892.0]]make sure that the most important things
[[2896.16]]are being done well and what's
[[2900.84]]interesting is I also realized like you
[[2905.6]]know being in a meeting and and being
[[2909.84]]The Village at meeting is actually very
[[2913.32]]powerful because if I ask a question
[[2916.24]]that some people perceive as a dumb
[[2919.16]]question like hey I don't understand
[[2922.56]]what you're saying or this doesn't make
[[2927.0]]sense to me you could see the people in
[[2931.72]]the room just relax and say thank God
[[2934.92]]Dave asked that question because I had
[[2937.4]]the same question but I didn't want to
[[2940.48]]look stupid in front of my peers by ask
[[2946.64]]that question and the problem with um um
[[2953.48]]a lot of what holds people back is shame
[[2957.36]]right if you think about an Innovative
[[2960.04]]culture where people want to you know
[[2963.16]]experiment and by definition it's not an
[[2966.64]]experiment if you is a guaranteed
[[2969.56]]success so some experiments are going to
[[2973.0]]work and some are going to fail and so
[[2978.08]]if there's a high if if shame is very
[[2983.68]]toxic in your in your culture then by
[[2987.4]]definition you're not going to take a
[[2991.4]]lot of risk and so being more vulnerable
[[2996.32]]is really a strength because enables
[[3001.4]]people to to really take more risk talk
[[3007.08]]about real issues not talk about some
[[3011.44]]you know High futen stuff deal with
[[3015.12]]problems as they come and acknowledge
[[3019.08]]that we don't have all the answers but
[[3023.24]]together we can get those answers how
[[3026.68]]does that tie into being a student of
[[3030.0]]the game and not a master of the game so
[[3034.32]]that saying comes into um a philosophy
[[3039.2]]high around leadership which is like as
[[3043.32]]your leaders you constantly have to
[[3047.68]]adapt how I was a COO at blade logic in
[[3053.04]]2001 and how I today two very different
[[3058.04]]people and I think one of the lessons
[[3062.08]]I've learned and we've gone through lots
[[3065.64]]of leadership changes here at mongodb as
[[3069.92]]we scaled from a $3 million business to
[[3075.64]]a$ 1.7 billion run rate business is that
[[3080.48]]the business needs different styles of
[[3083.48]]leadership at different stages of growth
[[3087.16]]and you know obviously managing 250
[[3090.44]]people is very different than managing
[[3094.76]]close to 5,000 people and when I see
[[3100.08]]leaders fail is they don't adapt because
[[3104.44]]they can't and one of the signals for me
[[3108.56]]and how effective leader is going to be
[[3112.56]]is can they introspect on what's going
[[3116.84]]well what they're doing well and also
[[3121.04]]what's not going well and then can they
[[3125.04]]act on that introspection a lot of
[[3128.36]]people can do the first part where they
[[3132.04]]can introspect but a lot of people just
[[3137.04]]can't adapt and evolve their style
[[3140.96]]because they realize the way they were
[[3144.56]]doing things is just not working anymore
[[3149.16]]I mean candidly uh right after we went
[[3155.28]]public I to I part aways with our cro
[[3161.76]]and so that's a pretty you know if you
[[3165.76]]think about pretty frightening thought
[[3168.84]]you're a newly minted public company and
[[3172.28]]a quarter after you go public you part
[[3175.44]]ways through the C and I became the
[[3179.68]]interm cro until promoting our existing
[[3184.2]]cro was Cedric pesh who was running
[[3187.52]]Europe at the time and he's done a
[[3192.6]]fabulous job but one of the reasons is
[[3197.88]]that leaders just can't adapt as the
[[3202.36]]business is growing and so uh and so
[[3206.68]]being a student of the game is meaning
[[3210.64]]that you're very curious and you're also
[[3214.68]]very coachable right but you're curious
[[3218.48]]because I want to understand what I'm
[[3222.48]]doing well what more I need to do how I
[[3226.88]]need to adapt to different situations
[[3233.0]]domains you know and and experiences and
[[3239.32]]then have the mindset that I constantly
[[3243.36]]have to learn and grow how does
[[3246.96]]self-awareness tie into that and also
[[3251.8]]the the Steve walsky two circles Point
[[3256.6]]yeah yeah so uh so for those people
[[3260.44]]trying to figure out what that meant was
[[3263.84]]I remember I was having a discussion
[[3267.08]]with Steve walsky who was uh the
[[3273.28]]chairman CE PTC and um Mentor viewers on
[[3279.96]]yeah so when I Jo when I started BL
[[3283.36]]logic I never worked at a software
[[3286.36]]company and obviously i' never been a
[[3289.92]]CEO of a software company so I very was
[[3294.2]]very clear that I have a lot to learn so
[[3297.92]]I went to my board and said who's the
[[3301.32]]best softare seer in Boston and they all
[[3305.24]]said this guy named Steve wski they said
[[3308.64]]yeah but he eats nails for breakfast
[[3311.72]]here's the number but good luck so I
[[3315.2]]kept pounding the phone either every
[[3318.28]]week or every other week finally he
[[3322.0]]returned my call I met with him and for
[[3326.0]]some reason we clicked and he decided
[[3329.12]]first to be an adviser then later became
[[3332.04]]a board member and then ultimately
[[3335.88]]chairman of Blade logic so one day we're
[[3339.96]]in you know having a debate discussion
[[3343.84]]about a person and then he he went to
[[3347.84]]the Whiteboard and draw two concentric
[[3351.6]]circles and he says Dave this is the
[[3355.0]]meaning of life and I looked at those
[[3358.12]]two concerts I was like Target what's he
[[3362.16]]talking about and he goes what he said
[[3366.8]]was the Outer Circle is how people
[[3371.84]]believe they really are who they are the
[[3376.68]]inner circle is really who they are and
[[3380.44]]the point he was saying was that people
[[3383.64]]always have an overinflated opinion of
[[3387.16]]themselves now it's fine because there's
[[3390.8]]always going to be some gap between your
[[3394.56]]own self perception versus what other
[[3398.68]]perceive of you but when that Gap is
[[3402.96]]really wide that's when real damage can
[[3407.52]]be done and um you know one of John
[[3411.84]]mcmah who I worked with on a couple
[[3416.04]]companies one of his best lines in terms
[[3420.76]]of assessing how self-aware someone is
[[3425.08]]is he ask people what do you think
[[3428.36]]people say about you when you leave the
[[3432.52]]room and the most self-aware people can
[[3437.08]]be quite on point about what
[[3440.32]]acknowledging the strengths and weakness
[[3444.88]]is the most self unaware people have no
[[3449.64]]clue they just have a completely
[[3453.36]]different picture of who they are and
[[3457.08]]what I found is that the best leaders
[[3460.92]]are incredibly self-aware why because
[[3465.0]]they can read the room they can see what
[[3468.56]]messages are landing what messages are
[[3471.48]]not how they have to adapt their Stu
[[3474.96]]style maybe eight out of 10 people are
[[3478.64]]bought in but there's two people who
[[3482.44]]look pretty grumpy are not happy so he
[[3486.28]]or she knows that they need to go talk
[[3489.24]]to those two people to figure out what's
[[3493.68]]going on with them and also also
[[3497.72]]understand their own biases what
[[3502.08]]triggers them um and also um what they
[[3508.32]]may kind of have uh blind spots to and
[[3513.56]]so being self-aware is incredibly
[[3517.92]]important to Be an Effective leader hey
[[3521.76]]guys Rashad here I'm the producer of the
[[3525.36]]Logan Bartlett show and wanted to take a
[[3529.64]]quick second to make an Ask we are close
[[3534.4]]to 10,000 subscribers and are trying to
[[3538.28]]get there by the end of the year if
[[3541.76]]you're enjoying this conversation and
[[3545.16]]these episodes please consider
[[3548.6]]subscribing to the YouTube channel now
[[3552.88]]back to the show I've heard from people
[[3556.88]]that you work with and even impr prep
[[3561.08]]before this that you all have built a
[[3566.2]]very transparent culture here how do you
[[3570.84]]go about building transparency within
[[3575.0]]the culture and honesty and all I think
[[3578.72]]it's also tied to vulnerability one of
[[3582.52]]my pet peeves I started off my career at
[[3586.24]]at a large I start I came out
[[3589.76]]engineering school I went to AT&T in
[[3595.16]]Bell Division and AT&T had some amazing
[[3600.24]]people but what the culture there was
[[3603.4]]very passive aggressive and it's quite
[[3607.24]]endemic when BL logic acquired by BMC
[[3610.96]]the culture there was very passive
[[3614.16]]aggressive and to me passive
[[3617.76]]aggressiveness is a form of duplicity
[[3621.2]]you know imagine you're in a meeting the
[[3624.6]]senior leaders running the meeting
[[3627.8]]you're they're debating And discussing
[[3630.68]]the topic the senior says I think we
[[3633.92]]should do this and everyone nods
[[3637.08]]politely say yes that's the right thing
[[3640.36]]to do the meeting ends everyone walks
[[3644.52]]out of the theuh conference room and
[[3647.88]]then they roll their eyes and say
[[3651.48]]that'll never work that to me is a form
[[3655.84]]of passive aggressiveness like I want to
[[3659.12]]create a culture where we can have
[[3662.48]]Fierce conversations and debates
[[3666.36]]constructively about what to do and what
[[3670.32]]not to do but at the end of the day the
[[3673.96]]best idea wins not the most senior
[[3677.56]]leaders idea wins right and that is
[[3681.28]]amazing because it creates a culture of
[[3685.52]]meritocracy so no matter who you are if
[[3690.32]]you have you know an Insight that you
[[3694.4]]think is incredibly valuable you should
[[3698.8]]feel comfortable sharing it and and and
[[3703.4]]people will buy in if they think that
[[3708.48]]that idea has Merit and so um so that's
[[3714.08]]super important and also transparency
[[3719.12]]also means talking about the bad stuff a
[[3723.28]]lot of companies and actually when I got
[[3727.0]]here the joke was the management team
[[3730.44]]before me would only talk about good
[[3733.76]]things would never talk about bad things
[[3737.16]]and I always found when I was a younger
[[3739.92]]employee that it insulted my
[[3743.8]]intelligence when senior leaders kind of
[[3748.88]]basically um you know communicated in a
[[3753.04]]propaganda kind of way like I was like
[[3756.52]]okay come on that's not really true and
[[3759.88]]I think most people can see right
[[3763.48]]through you and so I always felt it's
[[3767.68]]really important to build credibility is
[[3771.52]]to really talk about both what's going
[[3774.68]]well and what the real issues and
[[3777.36]]problems are in the business and how are
[[3780.36]]we going to talk about them because once
[[3783.36]]what was interesting and I do that with
[[3786.64]]the board as well and I Mentor younger
[[3790.52]]CR saying when you tell a experienced
[[3793.76]]board member that everything is going
[[3797.2]]fabulously well they either will
[[3800.56]]immedately think one of two things
[[3803.12]]either you don't know what you don't
[[3806.12]]know or you're lying to them because
[[3809.48]]every company even the best run
[[3812.8]]companies have something blowing up
[[3816.52]]somewhere right and so I start my
[[3820.0]]meetings always talking about problems
[[3823.28]]here's the issues and challenges I'm
[[3827.12]]struggling with here's what's going on
[[3831.28]]Team Dynamics here's you know people I'm
[[3835.8]]worried about um you know when the team
[[3839.84]]comes in this is where I encourage you
[[3843.56]]to probe blah blah blah and what's
[[3848.48]]interesting is the more um my commitment
[[3852.92]]to the board is they will typically
[[3857.44]]never hear any bad news uh you know um
[[3861.6]]they'll typically hear bad news from me
[[3865.12]]first what it does is it disarms the
[[3868.88]]board because the board never feels like
[[3871.88]]I'm trying to hide information and then
[[3875.36]]they're leaning in to help me and in
[[3878.8]]fact the board has commented I give them
[[3882.32]]a lot of access to people multiple
[[3886.0]]levels below me so I have teams come in
[[3888.76]]based on say we're talking about a
[[3891.72]]particular project or particular
[[3895.2]]function so they love that they have
[[3899.48]]visibility many levels layers into the
[[3904.32]]organization for you know one more
[[3908.92]]transparency two they can see this the
[[3913.84]]depth of our bench and get a sense of
[[3918.56]]you know the culture that we have and I
[[3923.28]]find that incredibly powerful I spoke to
[[3927.4]]one of your former board members and he
[[3932.4]]said that uh you are one of the best
[[3938.76]]people he's ever worked with on doing
[[3943.4]]what you say you're going to do and
[[3946.76]]holding people accountable so that they
[[3950.6]]actually execute on whatever said is
[[3954.24]]actually going to be done how do you go
[[3956.8]]about building a culture of
[[3959.56]]accountability and actually making sure
[[3962.68]]people follow through and what they say
[[3966.12]]they're going to do um this is tied to
[[3969.84]]something else I always believe bad news
[[3973.28]]travels very slowly up the organization
[[3976.92]]but very quickly down the organization
[[3980.28]]good news will find me anywhere I could
[[3983.32]]be in a beach in the sou of France I
[[3987.4]]could be in in Hawaii or Tahiti and good
[[3992.08]]news will find me and but bad news I
[[3996.88]]have to go looking for and so whenever I
[[4001.4]]hear bad news I assume me assume two
[[4006.12]]things one I'm the last to know and two
[[4010.04]]it's far worse than what people are
[[4012.72]]telling me because invariably people
[[4016.84]]always modify or shave a little bit of
[[4021.0]]the truth to be a little bit more
[[4024.84]]diplomatic and in you know in a simple
[[4029.4]]example would be um you have you have a
[[4033.68]]customer who's starting to throw you out
[[4037.92]]the sales team tells their the sales
[[4042.84]]manager we have a problem at AC company
[[4047.16]]you know over multiple layers the way it
[[4049.92]]comes to me is so we're deal we're
[[4052.76]]dealing with a slight problem in Acme
[[4055.56]]company but then two months later the
[[4058.48]]customer turns and you're like how the
[[4062.2]]heck did that happen now we don't do
[[4065.4]]that here but that's an example of what
[[4069.36]]happens in most companies so we try to
[[4074.8]]really encourage sharing of bad news and
[[4080.92]]we try uh not to shoot the messenger
[[4085.56]]sometimes we're you know some people not
[[4088.44]]good at that but that's really important
[[4091.56]]because you can't get people to share
[[4094.2]]bad news that feel like they're going to
[[4097.6]]get punished for it and then what that
[[4101.92]]also does is that it it elevates
[[4106.36]]problems quickly and I always believe
[[4110.96]]that people don't perform always per
[[4114.6]]perform to what you expect they perform
[[4117.44]]to what you inspect so if you have a
[[4120.96]]high culture of inspection how's this
[[4124.76]]project going what's happening the
[[4128.12]]forecast what's happening with that
[[4131.88]]person what's happening with team you
[[4135.76]]end up invariably finding out what's
[[4139.6]]going on and the more inspection you
[[4144.08]]have not micromanagement inspection and
[[4149.4]]you do part of your operating Rhythm the
[[4154.4]]more quickly you can identify problems
[[4158.8]]and so um and this is back to the drri
[[4162.8]]thing like if you have a good drri who's
[[4166.44]]very clear what good looks like has
[[4169.8]]buying from Key stakeholders and you're
[[4173.24]]clear on the on the measurements then
[[4176.88]]when they come and Report it's very easy
[[4181.64]]to now um report on progress against the
[[4186.36]]metrics that we think we defined a
[[4190.4]]success and when things are you know say
[[4195.24]]falling behind plan then you start
[[4199.24]]escalating that and saying I have a
[[4202.52]]problem you know we need to fix these
[[4206.52]]issues feedback loops keeping those very
[[4211.12]]tight it's super important with uh
[[4215.24]]companies in general but are certainly
[[4219.08]]fast growing companies so that you you
[[4223.04]]can be held accountable to what you're
[[4226.44]]say you're going to do and also be able
[[4229.44]]to iterate pretty quickly how do you go
[[4232.68]]about keeping uh feedback loops tight
[[4236.52]]within I think feedback is a gift
[[4241.08]]I think in every facet of life feedback
[[4244.8]]is important whether it's feedback to
[[4247.76]]your personal life if your partner's
[[4251.16]]annoyed at you you want to hear that
[[4254.04]]feedback because then you don't know
[[4257.4]]what's irritating and upsetting them and
[[4261.6]]then in the business side the shorter
[[4265.24]]the feedback loops the more responsive
[[4269.2]]you can be especially to customer needs
[[4273.4]]or Market opportunities you know and the
[[4276.56]]classic example is look at government
[[4279.4]]functions the feedback loops are very
[[4282.0]]long imagine going the Department of
[[4284.96]]Motor Vehicles you know you want to pull
[[4288.44]]your hair out because they're not that
[[4293.0]]attuned to customer feedback and so to
[[4297.88]]me feedback is very very important and
[[4302.52]]that again it's a created by a culture
[[4307.36]]of high trust being comfortable sharing
[[4312.92]]bad news uh having positive intent and
[[4317.84]]then actually acting on it because the
[[4320.72]]worst thing you can do is give feedback
[[4323.8]]and no one does anything about it and so
[[4326.72]]then you say like this company doesn't
[[4329.88]]care or this person doesn't care so you
[[4333.28]]have to have a bias to action now
[[4336.72]]sometimes you can say I hear you but
[[4340.08]]this is not as important as some other
[[4342.44]]things we're trying to do and we're
[[4345.2]]going to sequence this later and make
[[4348.44]]them understand that in the oral scheme
[[4351.32]]of things it may not be as important as
[[4354.44]]you think it is but it's important to
[[4357.92]]have that discussion in line on what's
[[4362.28]]what to do now versus later you guys
[[4367.84]]maintain hybrid as a uh work environment
[[4372.64]]today how have you thought about that
[[4376.92]]how do you make it work yeah so I don't
[[4381.28]]believe um well what's happened
[[4384.48]]especially here in New York a couple
[[4387.2]]years ago there's a notion of quiet
[[4390.84]]quitting or people belief that anyone
[[4394.68]]who working from home is not working as
[[4397.92]]hard as someone in the office I don't
[[4402.68]]believe that I think that you know how
[[4408.12]]the productivity of someone is defined
[[4412.68]]by how aligned they are to the mission
[[4417.0]]of the company how aligned how clear are
[[4420.92]]the objectives of what they're uh what
[[4425.32]]they're trying to do and how closely and
[[4430.32]]how well they're held accountable and so
[[4434.72]]I also when I talk to employees they
[[4439.16]]value the flexibility you know in a
[[4444.28]]world where the boundaries of when work
[[4448.92]]stops and when your private life you
[[4453.28]]know begins in the day is now blurred
[[4457.92]]right so people value I had a employee
[[4461.72]]tell me the most important part of my
[[4465.28]]day is being able to pick up my child
[[4469.48]]from school uh that's a very important
[[4473.16]]moment for me but this person Works
[[4477.28]]incredibly hard and is a high performer
[[4482.08]]but but that flexibility you know makes
[[4486.04]]her much more committed to mangabb
[[4489.56]]because she has that flexibility to be
[[4493.12]]either other people love the fact that
[[4495.96]]hey in the middle of the day I've got to
[[4498.88]]go see the dentist or have a doctor
[[4502.6]]appointment or take care of an errand
[[4506.04]]now we do also believe in the importance
[[4510.56]]of in-person meetings but I think uh you
[[4515.76]]know it's not like people are talking to
[[4519.56]]each other every minute of the day there
[[4522.96]]times of this burst of activity and then
[[4526.8]]you come in to calibrate whether it's a
[[4531.28]]qbr planning session you're kicking off
[[4535.64]]a project or you're coming in and
[[4539.76]]assessing the state of the project so I
[[4543.24]]don't think you need to be in the office
[[4545.72]]four or five days a week I think the
[[4548.6]]toothpaste is out of the tube with the
[[4551.24]]pandemic
[[4555.4]]and I think uh it's the way you hold
[[4559.72]]people accountable is through their
[[4563.44]]leadership and if you have a high bar
[[4568.24]]and high standards you can still drive
[[4571.88]]high productivity even if people are
[[4575.56]]working at home or in the office we
[[4579.76]]touched on you did a a riff when you
[[4584.64]]first got the mongod DB but uh but
[[4589.44]]during the pandemic and when when
[[4593.28]]everything kind of reverted back uh over
[[4597.0]]the course of as interest rates went up
[[4602.56]]you did not do a broad-based riff uh and
[[4609.36]]I think philosophically you're against
[[4615.6]]Rifts in general not for some moral
[[4621.2]]reason but because it masks a bunch of
[[4625.6]]performance and management related uh
[[4629.08]]considerations can you talk about
[[4632.36]]important I think um I think a risks
[[4636.32]]have a place if there's suddenly some
[[4640.4]]structural cost structure problem you
[[4644.2]]have in the business imagine if 50% of
[[4648.08]]your customers disappeared overnight
[[4651.32]]there's no amount of Performance
[[4653.68]]Management that can right siize the
[[4656.12]]business quickly and you have to make
[[4660.36]]some hard decisions but I the reason I
[[4665.2]]I'm allergic to Rifts in general is
[[4668.72]]because to me and this happened here at
[[4675.12]]M to be when we got a sense in um uh
[[4683.08]]2022 uh that the world was changing and
[[4688.24]]the you know and and things were going
[[4691.96]]to become very different a lot of people
[[4695.76]]came to said why don't you just do a RIS
[[4699.04]]you know that it'll be so easy to do
[[4702.72]]that and we're you know we will be all
[[4706.92]]good and it'll probably be even more
[[4710.52]]quick and more efficient than just doing
[[4714.44]]this performance management process and
[[4717.76]]what I said to them is that but they're
[[4721.0]]not teaching anyone any muscles right
[[4724.72]]and we're not teaching people one of the
[[4728.84]]biggest weaknesses of new managers even
[[4732.88]]existing managers is knowing how to hold
[[4736.12]]people accountable and I have a
[[4739.68]]three-step process on how how to hold
[[4743.28]]people accountable we I'll tell you that
[[4747.8]]later if you're interested but we want
[[4752.36]]to develop the muscles of knowing how to
[[4756.0]]hold people accountable and what was
[[4760.6]]interesting is that I had people who
[[4764.76]]came up to me after the process said you
[[4768.36]]know what Dave it was surprisingly easy
[[4772.64]]to find the bottom 5% and I said what
[[4777.28]]did that tell you it said that either we
[[4781.32]]hired the wrong people or we didn't
[[4784.36]]develop them but we clearly had a
[[4788.96]]problem and and it was the men put so me
[[4794.6]]pushing you is you caused you to deal
[[4798.28]]with that problem you weren't dealing
[[4800.88]]with that problem proactively and that
[[4804.64]]there in there in itself is a problem
[[4808.84]]and we need to be much more proactive in
[[4812.44]]dealing with performance issues because
[[4816.28]]the best people get very frustrated when
[[4819.76]]they work with people who are either not
[[4823.24]]as committed or not as competent as them
[[4827.08]]because now you're actually penalizing
[[4830.72]]all the good people are working hard to
[[4834.36]]cover for the people who are not
[[4837.76]]producing at the rate they should be now
[[4840.72]]I want to hear your three steps for
[[4844.24]]holding people accountable yeah so the
[[4847.68]]the first step is you got to be very
[[4851.6]]clear on what you want right um and so
[[4857.96]]you know for project for the role um in
[[4862.96]]this period whatever you got to be very
[[4866.68]]clear here are my expectations and so a
[[4871.96]]simple example would be say um I expect
[[4876.68]]um you you to send me a report every
[[4881.16]]Friday on the week's activities I'll
[[4886.04]]just make a trivial example and the
[[4890.84]]first Friday you don't send it to me and
[[4896.32]]then I see you on Monday I say hey where
[[4900.96]]Logan where's that report goes oh yeah I
[[4904.92]]forgot about it um I'll get it to you
[[4908.52]]and you then you send it to me and I go
[[4911.88]]to you and said Logan listen I may not
[[4915.28]]have been clear why that's important to
[[4918.56]]me but I use those reports to really
[[4921.08]]understand what's going on in the
[[4923.32]]business you your you and your team play
[[4926.88]]a really critical role and it's not just
[[4930.44]]makeup work this is really important to
[[4933.64]]me so the what I'm really doing is I'm
[[4937.84]]making the prom that was my fault to not
[[4942.12]]clearing making clear to you what the
[[4946.0]]importance was for why I'm asking you to
[[4950.44]]do this and then I said now are you
[[4954.72]]clear Logan does everything make sense
[[4959.12]]and you go yes I got it now the next
[[4963.84]]time you forget to send me that report
[[4968.0]]now it can hold you accountable so you
[[4971.32]]can't hold someone accountable if you
[[4975.24]]don't do steps one and steps two so most
[[4979.28]]people get terrified of holding people
[[4982.04]]accountable because one they're not
[[4985.08]]clear what they want and they've not
[[4989.72]]been giving clear feedback on when
[[4994.32]]there's been missteps and when you don't
[[4998.0]]give feedback you're basically Sending
[[5001.36]]message not just to Logan but to
[[5005.04]]everyone else you know what I want is
[[5009.28]]not really that important there's not a
[[5013.72]]really culture of discipline I am okay
[[5018.72]]to let people cut corners and that by
[[5023.52]]itself is sending a message that maybe
[[5027.2]]this is not as a high performance
[[5030.76]]organization as as it is and so going
[[5034.28]]through that three-step process at least
[[5038.4]]for me makes it much more easy to to
[[5042.84]]hold people accountable I've heard you
[[5045.92]]say that recruiting is like pipeline
[[5048.96]]management once you stop it even for a
[[5052.64]]bit it dries up how much of your time do
[[5057.08]]you spend recruiting today uh today not
[[5060.92]]as much obviously for senior level
[[5063.72]]recruiting I I spent a lot of time we
[[5067.24]]just hired a new CTO so I was obviously
[[5071.0]]intimately involved in that recruiting
[[5075.04]]process um and I was pleased that I
[[5079.76]]actually beat my own ambitious goal by a
[[5084.68]]month but uh that's a different subject
[[5089.24]]but uh um obviously recruiting it all
[[5094.12]]starts with recruiting and um um if you
[[5098.96]]can't hire the best people then nothing
[[5103.76]]else really matters in my mind um a
[[5108.0]]leader has to essentially do three
[[5111.48]]things one is recruit the best team
[[5116.92]]possible two develop them to get them to
[[5122.64]]do what you want them to do and three
[[5126.84]]make make sure they consistently meet
[[5130.32]]and exceed their commitments right so
[[5134.36]]recruit develop and execute but it all
[[5138.96]]starts with recruiting and I think mcmah
[[5142.88]]has said this before if you hire
[[5146.52]]mediocre people but do a great job in
[[5150.48]]development and really monly focus on
[[5153.8]]execution you'll still have a mediocre
[[5157.4]]outcome if you hire great people and do
[[5161.96]]an okay job on development an okay job
[[5165.84]]in inspection you can still have a
[[5168.72]]pretty good outcome so it all starts
[[5172.24]]with recruiting um the point about the
[[5177.48]]pipeline is that um like a sales
[[5182.76]]pipeline a recruiting pipeline dries up
[[5186.96]]pretty quickly so you're talking to
[[5190.84]]candidates you're screening candidates
[[5193.88]]but then if you say you know what I'm
[[5197.68]]not going to um um put focus on
[[5202.0]]recruiting those candidates will slowly
[[5205.4]]wither away and go somewhere else so
[[5209.48]]they you say oh my God I need to hire
[[5213.8]]100 people next quarter you can't
[[5217.76]]suddenly like magically produce 100
[[5221.84]]candidate 100 qualified candidates very
[[5225.8]]quickly so constantly being in the
[[5229.36]]market and talking to people even if you
[[5233.04]]don't have roles to fill and getting a
[[5238.2]]sense of who's great who's out there um
[[5242.72]]you know selling the message and the
[[5245.84]]value proposes among to be is important
[[5250.4]]for us because we're planting seeds
[[5254.6]]sometimes we need to harvest those seeds
[[5257.64]]very quickly sometimes we planning seeds
[[5261.32]]because we know in the future we we we
[[5265.0]]will want those people to consider
[[5268.4]]joining us one of the things I heard you
[[5272.24]]say in your interview process is that
[[5277.2]]you inspect how thoughtful everyone was
[[5282.64]]in switching between jobs why why is
[[5286.56]]that important how do you go about
[[5289.64]]thinking about it to me the most
[[5292.72]]important professional decision you can
[[5297.0]]make is what company to go to right so
[[5302.56]]so when I look at a resume um I try and
[[5306.6]]understand why did it go from company a
[[5309.4]]to Company B or why did they even start
[[5313.4]]a company a why did it go to Company B
[[5318.64]]and and then maybe C or D I'm trying to
[[5323.44]]understand the decision process and what
[[5326.92]]I'm really trying to assess is how
[[5330.36]]thoughtful were they in in making that
[[5334.24]]decision to go from company a to Company
[[5338.32]]B Because as I said that's a very very
[[5341.92]]important personal decision for that
[[5345.04]]person and if that person is pretty
[[5349.48]]Cavalier I followed my boss oh I got a
[[5353.56]]call from a recruiter and they offered
[[5358.04]]20% more uh then I'm thinking to myself
[[5363.84]]you know okay those might be interesting
[[5368.4]]signals but that's not a very thoughtful
[[5372.36]]process then I'm thinking to myself how
[[5375.56]]thoughtful they going to be when they're
[[5379.12]]in that job making day-to-day decisions
[[5383.0]]about what products to build what
[[5387.2]]marketing programs to execute on how to
[[5393.12]]prosecute you know sales deals Etc and
[[5398.4]]so that to me is a really high quality
[[5402.8]]signal about the kind of person they are
[[5406.88]]whereas conversely if they're incredibly
[[5411.0]]thoughtful and saying I was really happy
[[5416.04]]here but I saw this new emerging Trend I
[[5419.84]]was really intrigued by this new
[[5423.12]]technology Trend I talked to five or six
[[5427.24]]different companies of those five or six
[[5431.36]]companies this company seemed the most
[[5436.4]]interesting I coold call them got a
[[5440.56]]bunch of meetings and then they timately
[[5443.6]]offer jobs and now that's a person who's
[[5447.72]]incredibly thoughtful I automatically SU
[[5451.6]]if someone's been in a job for two years
[[5456.6]]and less they failed unless there's
[[5462.0]]clear evidence that there was another
[[5465.48]]reason why they left you know I.E they
[[5468.6]]got married and had to move to another
[[5472.32]]city or there's some personal event
[[5476.0]]their life or the company got Acquired
[[5478.88]]and they shut down that operation
[[5483.12]]whatever why two years because in most
[[5487.32]]companies it takes about a year to
[[5489.88]]figure out that someone's not working
[[5493.12]]out and then another year to get rid of
[[5496.8]]them so if you've been at a company for
[[5500.44]]less than two years unless you can
[[5505.16]]convince me clearly convince me why I've
[[5510.04]]automatically assumed you failed any
[[5513.52]]favorite interview questions or things
[[5516.44]]you try to tease out in an interview
[[5519.4]]besides the thoughtfulness by which they
[[5524.08]]switch jobs um yeah I would say um
[[5529.76]]understanding um both why this Swit job
[[5534.04]]the other thing I like to Probe on is
[[5537.16]]give me an example of something you're
[[5540.2]]really proud of you know what is what is
[[5544.2]]a really proud accomplishment and
[[5548.2]]they'll tell me they closed this deal
[[5552.0]]they got this product out the door blah
[[5555.88]]blah blah then I'll start drilling in
[[5559.16]]and tell me more and go into
[[5563.36]]excruciating detail and if they have the
[[5568.12]]details at their fingertips that tells
[[5571.84]]me they were directly involved if there
[[5575.6]]were like a tertiary team member of some
[[5579.0]]project that was successful at that
[[5582.84]]company then very quickly I can figure
[[5586.84]]out that they weren't really involved
[[5591.12]]but they were just you know trying to um
[[5596.0]]essentially get credit for that you know
[[5599.92]]that project or that initiative that the
[[5603.64]]company undertook so that tells me again
[[5607.92]]how how intimately involved they were in
[[5611.76]]those in in quote unquote their most
[[5615.12]]proudest moment right if it's your most
[[5618.2]]proudest moment it's got to be something
[[5621.56]]that you should be directly and
[[5625.68]]intimately aware of if a job opens up
[[5629.32]]internally and you have an internal
[[5633.12]]candidate uh versus an external
[[5636.56]]candidate obviously you have a
[[5639.48]]disproportionate amount of information
[[5642.72]]about the person you've worked with in
[[5646.68]]the past and you're comparing to someone
[[5650.64]]externally how do you think about
[[5654.88]]evaluating those two people for the job
[[5659.88]]and how do you think about uh
[[5664.32]]discounting or maybe factoring in how
[[5667.92]]much you know about the internal
[[5671.8]]candidate versus the external one yeah
[[5676.68]]so just stepping back I was and the
[[5680.64]]thing I've said here mang and I said at
[[5683.72]]blade logic was I want people to come
[[5686.84]]here to build a career not to come here
[[5689.6]]for a job
[[5692.36]]but the problem here's the problem that
[[5696.76]]most leaders run into is that they have
[[5701.32]]their own existing team now they have a
[[5705.96]]job opening you know Joe or Sally are
[[5710.64]]are interested in that job but you have
[[5714.36]]a very nuanced opinion of them because
[[5717.68]]you see what they're good at but you
[[5720.4]]also see some of the things that maybe
[[5722.88]]they're not so good at in some of the
[[5726.0]]wards but it's a very nuanced
[[5730.24]]perspective on on Joe and Sally
[[5735.4]]meanwhile Jon shows up with a pristine
[[5741.0]]resume you know comes in presents the
[[5747.32]]best sense of him uh of himself
[[5753.0]]um and now all a sudden you're like wow
[[5756.84]]John's got all this credentials he's got
[[5760.2]]this track record he's got all these
[[5764.48]]results maybe I should hire John what
[[5769.08]]happens is you end up hiring John
[[5772.24]]because you have an asymmetry
[[5775.08]]information you only see the good stuff
[[5777.76]]about John but you have much more
[[5781.6]]nuanced view of Sally and Joe and then
[[5785.52]]six months later you realize well you
[[5788.52]]know John can't doesn't walk on water
[[5791.96]]either he's got things that he's good at
[[5794.88]]and he's got things that he doesn't good
[[5797.68]]at but what you've done is now you
[[5802.32]]demotivated Sally and and Joe and now
[[5806.96]]all of a sudden they say maybe this is
[[5810.52]]not the place for me now a sudden they
[[5813.88]]say maybe I should contemplate going
[[5817.24]]somewhere else so I'm not suggesting
[[5820.56]]that you never hire from the outside of
[[5823.64]]course we've hired from the outside but
[[5827.44]]you want to make sure your people inside
[[5830.64]]the company especially the people who
[[5834.04]]are performing are given a fair shot for
[[5837.2]]growth
[[5839.96]]opportunities you you also don't want to
[[5843.08]]do just have blind spots and say I'm
[[5845.72]]only going to you know promote someone
[[5848.2]]internally you want to make sure that
[[5850.68]]you assess the temple and the
[[5854.08]]marketplace and that to me is the best
[[5857.44]]way to really make the right decisions
[[5861.2]]for the business but ideally if push
[[5865.72]]comes to shove I much rather promote
[[5869.96]]within because it creates a meritocracy
[[5874.28]]you retain the culture and you basically
[[5878.04]]know what you're getting far better than
[[5881.76]]anyone from the outside in a fast
[[5886.48]]growing company uh the the slope of the
[[5890.96]]business often times will outpace the
[[5895.6]]slope of the individual in that role how
[[5900.88]]do you make decisions about if someone's
[[5906.48]]been good for up to that point in time
[[5911.64]]but it is time to maybe move on and
[[5915.84]]bring on someone from the outside how do
[[5919.88]]you think about the that that balance
[[5923.92]]and tradeoff so my philosophy on that is
[[5927.68]]you can usually fool the people above
[[5930.88]]you you can sometimes fool the people
[[5934.0]]around you you can never fool the people
[[5937.68]]below you and the biggest tell for me if
[[5943.12]]a leader is not scaling is how
[[5948.52]]frustrated is their team becoming are
[[5952.36]]good people starting to leave is the
[[5955.32]]quality of the new people that the
[[5958.68]]leader recruiting is now no longer a but
[[5963.6]]now like B's and B minuses and C's that
[[5968.24]]to me is a huge tell about whether not a
[[5972.64]]leader scaling because the people who
[[5977.24]]work for you clearly know how effective
[[5980.56]]you are clearly know the quality of
[[5983.72]]decisions you're making clearly know if
[[5987.92]]you're being a hindrance or or an asset
[[5991.64]]in terms of enabling them to get their
[[5995.24]]jobs done and so that will show up very
[[5999.68]]quickly to them and so that to me is the
[[6003.6]]best hell and in fact when I joined
[[6006.88]]mongodb one of the first things I did
[[6011.0]]was review all the organizations and I
[[6015.56]]tried to understand you know who was in
[[6020.52]]these teams what the level of turn was
[[6024.76]]and uh the quality of the people in
[[6029.08]]those teams and that gave me a great map
[[6033.44]]about where the problems were in the
[[6036.4]]organization and that also informed my
[[6040.08]]decision of where to focus first and I
[[6045.04]]think that just remains and and um it
[[6049.64]]may seem awkward to say this but we've
[[6053.04]]gone through many leadership transitions
[[6057.12]]I've been through three CMOS I've been
[[6062.08]]through two two CFOs I've been through
[[6068.04]]three cro I've been to uh two Chief
[[6073.88]]product officers um I've been through
[[6078.96]]three CTO and that's is just a function
[[6083.48]]of the business scaling very quickly but
[[6087.08]]not everyone scales at the same rate now
[[6090.4]]now some people left on their own
[[6093.52]]valtion they were tired and they you
[[6097.4]]know want to take some time off but in
[[6101.52]]many cases the people just can scale to
[[6105.08]]the next level now your parents gave you
[[6108.48]]two options Prof professional you could
[[6112.24]]either be an engineer or a doctor right
[[6116.44]]and ultimately you found your way uh
[[6121.16]]finding religion in sales as well how
[[6126.32]]how did you discover sales as something
[[6131.68]]that you you had passion for and what
[[6136.88]]would you tell to CEOs that maybe view
[[6141.72]]it as a black art or something
[[6146.88]]Unbecoming yeah well my dad was a a
[[6151.16]]rocket a true rocket scientist he
[[6155.64]]designed uh rocket engines and and and
[[6161.16]]satellites and so um he always viewed
[[6165.52]]sales as like a bunch of Youth scar
[[6168.84]]sales guys thought it was not a very
[[6172.84]]honorable profession so so what was
[[6177.36]]interesting is uh when I started working
[[6181.36]]I was in this rotational assignment at
[[6184.76]]AT&T where a gave me exposure to
[[6188.24]]different functions and the functions
[[6191.72]]that were closest to the customer where
[[6196.12]]I could see the intersection of business
[[6201.4]]technology uh coming together was where
[[6206.12]]I got really you know interested and
[[6210.4]]excited I personally knew that I didn't
[[6213.96]]want to be like a hardcore developer or
[[6217.64]]some engineer in a back room designing
[[6221.0]]you know circuit boards or something
[[6224.56]]like that so I felt like I wanted to be
[[6228.24]]where the business business and the
[[6232.28]]technology came together and then as I
[[6236.32]]started learning more and more my
[[6239.44]]business I realized sales is so
[[6244.36]]important to um to the success of any
[[6250.56]]business uh at being having its monop
[[6255.16]]Monopoly Roots didn't really actually
[[6258.28]]have a great Salesforce and I went to a
[[6262.52]]smaller Telecom Comal uh teleport which
[[6267.12]]is a celect they also had an okay
[[6271.44]]Salesforce so one of the reasons I I
[[6275.68]]reached out to Steve walski is because
[[6279.44]]PTC had this reputation of having a
[[6283.68]]great product and also an amazing
[[6288.2]]Salesforce and Steve and I talked about
[[6292.96]]that and as he framed it which I live
[[6297.32]]today is like if you marry a great
[[6301.0]]product with a great goto Market engine
[[6304.28]]obviously in the old days only sales for
[[6306.92]]us is now
[[6310.28]]self-service um and various different
[[6314.76]]sales channels uh you that's where the
[[6319.52]]magic happens and what I tell people is
[[6323.36]]that as much thought as we put into
[[6326.8]]product we also think about very hard
[[6330.28]]about how we're thinking about how we go
[[6334.64]]to market how customer buying Behavior
[[6340.28]]changed and I believe that if you can
[[6344.72]]make product and go to market
[[6347.8]]competitive advantage that that really
[[6350.96]]differentiates you from other companies
[[6355.64]]in the industry now I I every job I I've
[[6360.44]]heard you say and I agree with has
[[6364.48]]something that you hate about it uh I
[[6368.36]]think we live in this culture of people
[[6372.6]]looking for this perfect thing out there
[[6377.8]]and job hopping and all of that um is
[[6381.92]]there can you elaborate on that point
[[6384.96]]and what advice would you have for young
[[6388.76]]professionals that are maybe uh trying
[[6392.88]]to find the perfect job with nothing
[[6396.92]]that they they hate in in terms of their
[[6400.12]]profession yeah I don't think the
[[6402.68]]perfect job exists I think there's
[[6405.84]]things you can find that you love to do
[[6410.12]]but there would be fast that job that
[[6415.2]]are maybe not as as enjoyable and I I
[[6420.12]]find when I the other thing when I talk
[[6424.08]]to people why they move from say company
[[6427.28]]a to Company B what I'm also trying to
[[6430.4]]understand is are they running away from
[[6434.16]]something or they running to something
[[6438.28]]and what I find is a lot of people
[[6442.8]]especially this younger generation they
[[6447.12]]don't NE have the skills to deal with
[[6451.04]]adversity so their inclination is to run
[[6454.84]]away from adversity and go to somewhere
[[6457.68]]else where to think that grass is
[[6462.24]]greener and and I tell my own boys
[[6467.32]]happiness and success is not the absence
[[6470.72]]of problems is the ability to deal with
[[6474.08]]them you may have a boss that you don't
[[6478.72]]get along with you may have um you know
[[6483.6]]you're dealing with a difficult customer
[[6487.72]]and uh they're very unreasonable you
[[6492.12]]know what are you going to do uh you may
[[6496.24]]have a product that doesn't always work
[[6499.68]]and and you're frustrated because it's
[[6503.12]]it's it's awkward it's embarrassing you
[[6507.12]]in front of if you're a salesperson uh
[[6511.52]]in front of your customers who trust and
[[6515.64]]respect you this going to be always
[[6519.6]]situations and difficult things you can
[[6523.32]]choose to run away or you can say how am
[[6526.32]]I going to fix this problem or how am I
[[6529.56]]going to Elevate this issue that that
[[6533.0]]someone who can fix this problem fix
[[6536.24]]this problem to me those are really
[[6540.04]]important life lessons now obviously if
[[6544.72]]a company's in like a death spiral no
[[6549.36]]one's suggesting you keep staying there
[[6553.08]]but I think it's important for people to
[[6556.4]]learn how to deal with adversity you
[[6559.72]]know obviously grit is something that we
[[6563.8]]think a lot about uh and you know one of
[[6567.68]]the characteristics we look for is are
[[6571.32]]these people do these people have grit
[[6575.8]]and one of the things or as some people
[[6581.12]]call do they fight or flee I'm a fighter
[[6586.52]]and uh and I hope to find other people
[[6592.44]]who uh who have that orientation to to
[[6597.84]]buckle down when things get tough no
[[6601.48]]we've referenced McMahon and walski but
[[6605.24]]I want to back up to the uh to the
[[6609.16]]original days of Blade logic so can you
[[6612.6]]tell the story of how blade logic came
[[6616.32]]to be and then maybe the fortuitous
[[6620.72]]timing of the fundraise and that Journey
[[6624.72]]sure so I had been at a company called
[[6628.08]]Breakaway Solutions which and I had
[[6630.96]]started a company called applica which
[[6635.0]]is the Corpus of their cloud computing
[[6638.84]]business so we are like a first
[[6641.68]]generation cloud computing being Telco
[[6645.68]]guys we call ourselves application
[[6649.36]]service provider so it was a very sexy
[[6652.92]]ter yes and being Telco guys we thought
[[6656.64]]it all about the sophistication of the
[[6659.8]]network not anything to do with the
[[6663.36]]application so while Ben off was
[[6666.8]]launching Salesforce and thinking about
[[6669.88]]a radically new multi-tenant
[[6673.2]]architecture we were thinking about it's
[[6676.36]]all about the network and and because
[[6680.12]]we're we were data Broadband networking
[[6683.68]]guys the network could solve the whole
[[6686.96]]problem obviously we were wrong um we
[[6690.52]]ended up taking that company public and
[[6695.16]]then um 70% of our customers were Dooms
[[6699.8]]and then obviously we saw the rise and
[[6703.12]]fall of the first B bubble what was the
[[6708.0]]peak Market gap of that uh 5 billion wow
[[6714.04]]and so um that being said we were we had
[[6718.8]]um essentially like 11 data centers
[[6721.96]]around the world they were Colo sites
[[6724.48]]but we were provisioning and managing
[[6727.24]]all the infrastructure and as the
[[6731.08]]business was scaling I was constantly
[[6734.68]]throwing people at that prom to
[[6737.48]]provision manage infrastructure because
[[6740.28]]with the first generation of Internet
[[6743.56]]architecture the complexity was moving
[[6748.4]]from the desktop to the back end within
[[6754.08]]clients and um and I was like shocked
[[6757.92]]when things started getting tougher I
[[6760.48]]said there's got to be tools to automate
[[6763.32]]this because we just can't keep throwing
[[6766.56]]people at the problem and I was shocked
[[6769.8]]to find out that there were no tools
[[6772.68]]most of the tools were desktop tools it
[[6775.52]]just didn't really work in a server
[[6779.92]]oriented world so then um I left
[[6784.8]]breakway actually end up being an e
[[6788.6]]abimer and I kind of worked on this idea
[[6793.0]]and my co-founder was an e battery and
[[6797.28]]we both decided to work together we B
[[6801.16]]basically worked on this idea and we and
[[6804.6]]that was the Corpus of starting blade
[[6808.0]]logic was coming out with a new
[[6812.08]]server-based orientation to provision
[[6816.44]]and configure servers in data centers
[[6821.72]]and so this was in the summer of 2001
[[6825.92]]and you know we had done a bunch of
[[6829.0]]Market research and obviously the bubble
[[6833.16]]had just bursted so investors were quite
[[6836.72]]skittish about like funding new
[[6839.12]]companies because they were just dealing
[[6841.96]]with the trauma of all the companies
[[6845.48]]that were basically struggling so the
[[6849.24]]the bar was quite High and the
[[6853.28]]valuations were were not great so it's
[[6856.88]]quite expensive to raise Capital we end
[[6860.8]]up raising our first round 5 days before
[[6865.04]]911 W so you probably would not be
[[6868.36]]talking to me today if IID waited five
[[6871.2]]days longer right because that deal
[[6874.16]]probably would have fallen apart near
[[6877.28]]jagar wrote a blog post who let the
[[6881.04]]servers out uh after the Baja men who
[[6884.68]]let the dogs out I think it's still
[[6887.96]]somewhere on the internet if you can uh
[[6891.48]]if you can dig it up but going through
[[6894.4]]that Journey you guys competed
[[6898.28]]head-to-head with with opsware which uh
[[6903.04]]for for people that don't know was run
[[6907.6]]by Ben horror witz um and there was and
[[6912.44]]Mark Andre and Mark Andre and it was a
[[6918.32]]legendary uh uh battle I would say uh
[[6922.96]]that that I don't know if there's
[[6926.48]]anything that's even quite like it today
[[6931.56]]of of the culture and and you had John
[[6936.0]]McMahon they had bar cranny it was a
[[6940.08]]very it's interesting so actually so I
[[6944.32]]competed with loudcloud which is the
[[6947.68]]first version of opare when I was
[[6951.24]]running you know at Breakaway right so
[[6954.6]]they were another cloud computing
[[6957.08]]company and then they decided to
[[6959.92]]repurpose their software provisioning
[[6963.64]]tool into a software company where I
[[6967.32]]decided to start from a clean sheet of
[[6971.72]]paper um and by definition I felt we
[[6976.4]]always had the better product but Mark
[[6981.36]]and Ben are great marketeers and so what
[[6987.32]]was interesting is that um they had a
[[6991.96]]flagship account in EDS and then they
[[6994.84]]started trying to go after other
[[6997.92]]customers but they kept running into us
[[7001.76]]and we were beating them everywhere so
[[7005.92]]they realized what is these blade guys
[[7009.72]]doing that you know we just don't know
[[7013.4]]and they realized we had a PTC guy
[[7017.08]]running actually it wasn't McMahon it
[[7020.36]]was a guy named Steve San who was
[[7025.68]]another PTC guy so uh um so then they
[[7031.6]]decided to uh um basically follow the
[[7035.12]]same Playbook they actually did reach
[[7038.44]]out to John but they ended up hiring a
[[7042.84]]guy named Mark cranny uh who also kind
[[7047.72]]of took the PTC Playbook and at the same
[[7052.96]]time Steve Tran again another example of
[[7057.32]]who did great work in the beginning but
[[7060.8]]then I realized wasn't scaling to the
[[7065.08]]next level that's when I recruited John
[[7069.28]]and so yes it ended up being two PTC
[[7073.84]]sales guys running two very aggressive
[[7079.32]]sales teams going after the market and
[[7084.44]]uh you know obviously um Mark and Ben
[[7090.12]]ultimately sold out to um HP uh and then
[[7095.72]]we ultimately got bought a year later um
[[7100.52]]by BMC soft and got bought what right
[[7104.44]]before lemman collapse you sort of book
[[7108.28]]in both crisises yes so the day we uh
[[7114.32]]closed our deal um was the day um uh JP
[[7120.08]]Morgan b b STS for three bucks a share
[[7124.88]]and the culture of blades Logic the
[[7129.04]]culture like the number of people that
[[7131.68]]have come through there I mean not just
[[7135.44]] but but data dog and Snowflake and
[[7139.88]]OCTA and we can sort of go down the list
[[7144.28]]of of other people that are zscaler uh
[[7148.56]]that power Enterprise selling in Silicon
[[7153.92]]Valley did you recognize at the time how
[[7160.16]]talented the sales folks you you had
[[7164.56]]within the organization were or is it
[[7167.8]]sort of a fish in water and you didn't
[[7171.0]]totally like these were just the people
[[7174.92]]around you no I I consciously wanted to
[[7179.72]]build I remember I I believed in wal's
[[7183.84]]philosophy that if you marry a great
[[7186.96]]product with great distribution that's
[[7189.92]]when the magic happen so I was very
[[7192.96]]conscious which is why I ended up
[[7196.6]]chasing after McMahon because he was
[[7200.16]]already even then a legend and and
[[7203.72]]saying would you considered joining um
[[7206.96]]BL logic and some people were actually
[[7210.32]]shocked that I was able to get him um
[[7214.32]]and then I would say the credit goes all
[[7219.08]]to John because the what John makes what
[[7223.96]]makes John really unique is I think one
[[7228.88]]he's an amazing listener um you know if
[[7233.76]]you talk to people when you interviews
[[7237.28]]people people feel like he looks into
[[7241.76]]their soul second thing he's a fabulous
[[7246.76]]recruiter so his I Talent is off the
[[7250.92]]chart so that's why the team was so good
[[7254.88]]because he could really pick out the
[[7259.08]]best people even if people with limited
[[7262.76]]track records but figured out they had
[[7266.64]]something really special about them
[[7271.4]]third he is an an incredible developer
[[7275.2]]of talent so it's not just recruiting
[[7278.8]]them but constantly train them and John
[[7282.8]]and I would work together what do we
[[7286.0]]what does the sales for need to learn
[[7288.88]]you know this quarter versus next some
[[7291.88]]of them would be sales specific issues
[[7295.48]]other would be product and Market issues
[[7299.48]]how to differentiate you know blade
[[7302.8]]logic versus opst and all the other
[[7306.92]]tools out there so developing Talent was
[[7310.96]]something that that was he was really
[[7314.2]]good at and then he was maniacal in
[[7318.8]]execution and so again recruit develop
[[7324.2]]and execute right and John was A+ in all
[[7328.84]]those categories now what about walski
[[7333.84]]as a mentor how did he influence you and
[[7338.92]]uh yeah why was he so good for you along
[[7344.84]]the way um so walski um I you know I I
[[7350.24]]give him a lot of credit for informing
[[7354.24]]my leadership philosophy he um all the
[[7358.52]]way from product and go to market and
[[7362.08]]bring the two together how to think
[[7366.16]]about like leadership how to think about
[[7370.84]]like fundraising how to think about like
[[7376.64]]managing the board um you know was so
[[7381.92]]because as a first-time board member it
[[7385.04]]this was all new to me and you just kind
[[7388.24]]of learn that quickly on the job now
[[7392.24]]there's a lot more data you know those
[[7396.48]]days the data was quite sparse and so
[[7400.56]]you really have to talk to people so I
[[7404.68]]do encourage firsttime Founders whether
[[7408.4]]not you have a board member or not but
[[7412.52]]find mentors who you can talk to because
[[7417.12]]the CR role is a very lonely job right
[[7421.16]]because everyone's advocating for
[[7425.04]]something it could be your team and and
[[7428.36]]not that they're they're being malicious
[[7430.88]]but they're Advocate things that are
[[7434.76]]important to them then you have um your
[[7439.16]]board and they're they're things that
[[7442.44]]they care a lot about too so when you
[[7445.8]]are thinking about things you want to
[[7449.44]]run something by a board member how it
[[7453.2]]affects them or maybe you know their
[[7456.52]]Equity position is going to have some
[[7459.76]]function of how they respond to that
[[7463.28]]idea similarly if you're thinking about
[[7466.48]]a restructuring the organization if you
[[7469.8]]want to socialize it with a few people
[[7473.44]]if it's going to potentially marginalize
[[7476.76]]some people they're not going to be very
[[7480.24]]happy with that so the SE role is a very
[[7484.48]]very lonely role and so having people
[[7488.12]]you can go to where you can just get
[[7492.48]]unvarnished advice be very comfortable
[[7497.28]]you know laying out what the issues are
[[7501.08]]and burying your soul and not worrying
[[7505.24]]about it being used against you is so so
[[7509.16]]important and wsk you play that role for
[[7512.84]]me I want to ask about the topic is your
[[7516.24]]right now which I think is on everyone's
[[7519.56]]mind artificial intelligence and you
[[7523.24]]guys are playing an important role in
[[7526.88]]that how how do you think about AI how
[[7530.16]]does it compare to past trends that
[[7533.72]]you've seen along the way and yeah the
[[7537.84]]risk is of of being a cliche I
[[7541.16]]definitely think is the next big
[[7544.84]]profound platform shift in our industry
[[7550.32]]um I think that uh what's interesting is
[[7555.6]]I would say AI 1.0 is all about focusing
[[7560.4]]on data scientists I think AI 2.0 where
[[7564.4]]you'll see much more broad-based
[[7567.64]]adoption especially around developers
[[7571.4]]who have to build smarter applications
[[7576.4]]and incorporate these new smarter
[[7582.08]]Technologies um we feel like we are well
[[7586.6]]positioned because it will unlock a lot
[[7589.72]]of opportunities where a lot of people
[[7593.44]]have been okay with keeping these Legacy
[[7597.28]]Platforms in place but now with the
[[7600.48]]Advent of AI it may it might be the
[[7603.64]]Catalyst for them to rethink about
[[7607.08]]modernizing big part of their
[[7610.76]]infrastructure uh we obviously have
[[7613.6]]announced some capabilities around
[[7616.56]]vector and so on so forth where people
[[7621.36]]can obviously leverage rag to marry
[[7626.44]]public data with private data to build
[[7630.72]]these smarter applications but I think
[[7635.16]]you know it's very very early days what
[[7638.8]]I'm really interest in understanding is
[[7642.48]]how does a developer workflow change
[[7646.4]]with the Advent of AI and I think we're
[[7649.4]]just at the early days of figing that
[[7652.96]]out and obviously we want to play a big
[[7657.28]]role in enabling that developer workflow
[[7661.36]]now you've been in uh New York City tech
[[7665.84]]for a long time right now were you up in
[[7669.96]]Boston for blade logic and then moved
[[7674.48]]down no I lived here I actually we had
[[7680.0]]our first uh child who just graduated uh
[[7687.28]]in May uh in in July of of 2001 and uh
[[7693.72]]and so moving was Impractical so I was
[[7698.48]]Community Up To Boston which wasn't easy
[[7702.96]]but basically you know I figured out a
[[7706.2]]way to do it I tried to start BL logic
[[7709.4]]in New York but it was just too
[[7713.24]]difficult because the ecosystem was in
[[7717.52]]place and the culture you you try to
[[7720.76]]talk to Wall Street people they say yeah
[[7723.08]]I work for a startup but they want to
[[7725.4]]keep their salary and still get a big
[[7729.16]]Equity you know position in the company
[[7733.72]]which obviously wasn't practical um now
[[7737.12]]I think it's very different here in New
[[7741.88]]York but yes um um I commuted up there
[[7748.12]]and uh and then obviously have always
[[7752.8]]lived in the New York area so what's
[[7756.48]]been your perspective of how New York's
[[7760.56]]changed over the last what 22 some odd
[[7765.8]]years working in Tech and uh ASP way
[[7771.0]]back when and now software today yeah so
[[7775.64]]I went from The Lone B2B guy to now
[[7779.48]]surrounded by you know companies like
[[7783.16]]data dog which I'm on the board of and
[[7787.32]]uh you know comes like uip Pat and I'm
[[7790.8]]glad you retired from being a VC by the
[[7794.88]]way yeah data dog is one of your only
[[7799.44]]Investments as a VC pretty good one yeah
[[7802.88]]yes well Olivia and the team there get
[[7806.92]]all the credit um and uh Etsy obviously
[[7811.6]]has also been a very successful company
[[7816.04]]um so to me New York is a fabulous place
[[7820.92]]right because one um your customers are
[[7824.68]]literally outside your front door you
[[7828.04]]have these amazing large companies
[[7831.72]]financial services companies and other
[[7835.36]]types of companies all in your backyard
[[7838.92]]two New York is a gateway to really
[[7841.68]]anywhere in the world you can get to
[[7844.2]]Europe very quickly it's like like a
[[7847.12]]West Coast Flight you can get to the
[[7850.44]]Middle East you can get to Asia and
[[7853.8]]going to Asia is not that much longer
[[7857.16]]from New York than it is say from San
[[7861.76]]Francisco I think um there's a obviously
[[7866.72]]a whole other dimension of New York in
[[7870.68]]terms of culture not everyone's in Tech
[[7874.68]]there's so many other things to me I've
[[7878.28]]been to almost every major city in the
[[7881.12]]world and I still think New York's the
[[7885.32]]best city so I'm I'm I'm I'm stoked that
[[7890.04]]uh New York is such a big tech center
[[7894.0]]now yeah that's great that's great uh
[[7897.6]]last one before I let you hop is there a
[[7901.52]]piece of conventional wisdom Silicon
[[7906.04]]Valley wisdom that you adamantly
[[7910.28]]disagree with that you hear get uh
[[7915.16]]shared quite a bit well the one thing I
[[7919.96]]think there's a pejorative uh
[[7923.68]]perspective on professional CEOs but
[[7926.48]]what's interesting is if you look at
[[7930.08]]like Nikes Aurora look at like Frank
[[7935.2]]slman I think I've done reasonably well
[[7940.32]]like professional CEOs have had Major
[[7945.92]]Impact Mark mlon before Nick Nesh have
[[7952.2]]some major now the founder friendly kind
[[7956.84]]of orientation makes a lot of sense
[[7959.92]]obviously you know these companies don't
[[7964.16]]start without Founders who think
[[7969.16]]differently and see PRS that or
[[7972.64]]opportunities that other people don't
[[7976.96]]see but I think uh most people have this
[[7982.0]]very pejorative view they almost think
[[7985.36]]oh the company's lost his way we they
[[7988.16]]have to bring a professional Co but when
[[7990.76]]you look at some of the biggest
[[7993.8]]companies in the world and some of the
[[7997.24]]most successful companies in the world
[[8001.08]]you know having the right professional
[[8005.64]]Co is not exactly a bad thing yeah good
[[8009.4]]well Dave thanks for doing this my
[[8013.64]]pleasure it's great to be
