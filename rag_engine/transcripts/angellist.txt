[[0]]let's not have meetings about meetings
[[3.48]]or process about process none of that
[[7.5]] matters right the only purpose for
[[11.52]]a company it's just a group of
[[14.82]]individuals that are coming together to
[[18.66]]build product for your customers any
[[22.5]]process anything that gets in the way of
[[25.56]]that crush it if we have too many
[[28.74]]meetings cancel the meetings like I'll
[[32.22]]regularly go cancel all my meetings on
[[35.88]]the calendar because all that really
[[40.14]]matters is that you're shipping products
[[44.16]]that your customers love
[[47.7]]and anything that gets in the way of
[[52.2]]that and you drag kill it crush it and
[[57.56]]just focus on speed
[[62.84]]avoc I'm so excited for this my friend
[[67.14]]it's been a while since we last had you
[[70.62]]on the show but I want to start on state
[[74.82]]with a little bit of context so how did
[[79.38]]you come to BC evangelist and what was
[[84.48]]that entry to the row fee yeah so the
[[90.06]]background is Naval who's one of the
[[94.98]]founders evangelist had been an investor
[[99.42]]in all three of the companies I've
[[103.5]]started uh so it started one company in
[[108.6]]2011 then another in 2014 and then
[[115.02]]another in 2017 and Naval is an investor
[[120.48]]in all three and when I wrapped up the
[[125.58]]acquisition of the last company I
[[130.86]]stepped back and was effectively going
[[135.18]]to just focus on investing so
[[139.2]]semi-retired life at that point for me
[[144.12]]since I wasn't building anything new
[[148.98]]um and Naval approached me to consider
[[154.56]]stepping in at Angelus as CEO as he'd
[[159.9]]already stepped back I believe in late
[[164.12]]2018 if I remember correctly
[[171.02]]and it was uh you know originally it was
[[178.2]]a hard hard decision but I said hey it's
[[182.16]]probably not the right fit I was just
[[185.7]]coming off of the last startup and as
[[190.2]]you know startups are a marathon and it
[[195.6]]gets quite intense uh but the idea of
[[200.88]]angeless and the concept of Angelus just
[[206.58]]stuck with me and we kept talking every
[[213.0]]week every other week and six months
[[218.22]]into it I fell in love with the uh
[[222.84]]opportunity and officially accepted in
[[228.18]]mid-july and uh Naval said can you start
[[233.52]]tomorrow and that was it and it's been
[[238.44]]crazy ever since now before we dive into
[[242.64]]some of the craziness I just have to ask
[[246.3]]about one of the startups he founded um
[[250.56]]believe it or not um you know lost small
[[255.96]]delivery is a passion area of mine and
[[261.84]]so my question to you is I know Goku
[[266.16]]um obviously and you kind of coincide
[[270.0]]around this uh with fast bite which was
[[273.78]]15 minute delivery and it was the first
[[277.74]]15 minute delivery startup what were
[[281.58]]your single biggest lessons from the
[[284.76]]first bite experience was goggles
[[288.36]]question so it was actually average
[[292.8]]delivery time was actually seven minutes
[[297.84]]um even though we build it as 15. I I
[[303.06]]would say I'll actually share two of the
[[308.4]]lessons I think first one is building
[[314.46]]for yourself will lead to a much higher
[[319.86]]probability of building something that
[[323.52]]people love because when you're building
[[327.36]]for yourself you then just need to
[[331.44]]believe you can find other people like
[[334.56]]yourself that are going to use the
[[338.22]]product and the second one and the
[[342.9]]reason I want to add this one is
[[348.36]]you want to think about the variables
[[353.34]]that you can optimize for the utility
[[356.4]]function of your product so every
[[359.58]]product any product you use has some
[[363.12]]utility function the utility function
[[367.62]]could be price convenience speed right
[[372.5]]anything the customer experience itself
[[376.88]]and you want to think about what are you
[[382.2]]optimizing on because different products
[[386.28]]actually have different diminishing
[[389.88]]returns and as you think about really
[[394.8]]fast delivery you can optimize on the
[[399.66]]delivery speed but then sometimes people
[[404.1]]actually don't want it to be as fast
[[407.46]]right they actually want it to be a
[[411.72]]little bit slower and so that was a
[[416.64]]pretty good lesson for me in terms of
[[419.88]]how to think about overall product
[[422.82]]experience it isn't just about a single
[[426.06]]variable what optimize on you want to
[[430.98]]optimize on multiple Goku made a special
[[436.14]]note of saying that it was really the
[[440.46]]first in Market to do this how important
[[445.5]]do you think is being the first I don't
[[450.78]]think being first in Market matters all
[[455.52]]that much and
[[459.3]]before I get into the answer for that
[[462.9]]question I'll introduce the idea of the
[[467.4]]concept of idmas which I believe Balaji
[[472.46]]had coined and I think there's a post on
[[478.54]]a16z's website on it and the idea may is
[[484.82]]basically uh talks about how every
[[488.64]]entrepreneur has to go through this
[[492.3]]journey of looking at an entire industry
[[497.6]]and looking at all the twists and turns
[[503.24]]and they base their business idea and
[[507.78]]their strategy accordingly
[[512.16]]and if you're first to Market you're
[[517.44]]effectively building the idmas for all
[[521.46]]the other entrepreneurs that'll come
[[525.9]]after you unless you navigate that idea
[[531.36]]maze yourself successfully and we've
[[536.4]]seen a ton of examples where sometimes
[[541.26]]first to Market isn't the company that
[[546.66]]wins the market uh Google I believe was
[[552.3]]a 17 search engine iPhone was not the
[[557.52]]first smartphone and so uh the way I
[[561.9]]think about first to Market is it
[[565.62]]doesn't guarantee success and you should
[[569.52]]probably assume you're building out the
[[573.36]]idmas for all the future Founders that
[[578.16]]will benefit from uh from your work I
[[582.9]]find so many investors oscillator on
[[586.44]]defensibility
[[589.2]]um and I think it's just complete
[[592.44]] especially at pre-seed and seed
[[596.58]]do you agree with me and finding it
[[600.54]]completely useless at pre-seed and seed
[[603.54]]or do you think there is inherent
[[607.26]]defensibility within companies so let's
[[612.96]]define defensibility as the cost to
[[618.24]]replicate your business as time goes on
[[622.68]]right when we say defensibility when we
[[626.7]]talk about moats what we're really
[[631.44]]saying is how easy is it or how costly
[[636.54]]would it be for someone to replicate
[[641.34]]your business and compete with you so
[[645.78]]definitionally
[[649.44]]you don't have any defensibility on day
[[653.4]]one because you don't have a business or
[[657.78]]even day 30 unless you magically get you
[[662.64]]know pretty large Network effects and
[[666.96]]even then I would I would doubt that
[[670.62]]because that means if you were able to
[[675.6]]get a large Network within a few days I
[[680.58]]mean someone else can do it as well so I
[[684.3]]agree with you I don't think there is
[[688.32]]any defensibility in day one final one
[[691.74]]and then I promise we'll get to the
[[694.74]]schedule but what did you think when you
[[698.52]]saw the host of European 15-minute
[[703.34]]delivery companies launch
[[710.18]]I thought I hope to God they are keeping
[[717.02]]track of the capital markets because
[[723.92]]anything in logistics anything in online
[[730.44]]uh offline to online or online to
[[734.7]]offline just requires a lot of capital
[[739.98]]and capital is really a function of the
[[745.14]]capital markets and the macro
[[750.12]]environment and so when I saw a lot of
[[754.92]]them launch and I think some of them
[[759.06]]also were in New York uh the number one
[[763.38]]thought that went through my mind was I
[[766.8]]hope they're keeping track of the
[[770.4]]capital markets because they will need a
[[774.6]]lot of money to scale today will go bust
[[780.0]]in the downturn 100 because the cost of
[[785.7]]capital goes up and when the cost of
[[792.18]]capital goes up you can't invest into uh
[[797.82]]launching new cities and you can't
[[802.08]]invest into what typically ends up being
[[806.58]]the J curve of this type of a business
[[810.18]]where you end up losing money every
[[814.56]]order and then at scale it's you know it
[[820.08]]spins back up and it does work but you
[[825.24]]need a lot of capital to sing in in but
[[829.44]]when the capital markets Rye up interest
[[833.88]]rates go up you where are you going to
[[837.84]]go get that Capital it is near
[[841.56]]impossible which is killing Industries
[[846.18]]one by one on 20vc last week we were
[[850.5]]like direct consumer subscription model
[[855.6]]does not work boom now we've just killed
[[860.4]]a whole other industry there good glad
[[863.76]]that we are continuously losing friends
[[867.3]]this is me that takes the heat for this
[[871.32]]don't worry and I do want to we spoke
[[874.98]]about kind of funding markets there I
[[877.74]]want to talk specifically about the
[[881.34]]funding Market that we have today so
[[885.3]]much has changed and you have this
[[889.26]]incredible purview at Angel list one of
[[893.52]]the most notable changes that you'll see
[[897.0]]and how companies are getting funded
[[901.56]]given the unique seat that you have yeah
[[908.4]]so for for context Angelus supports 20
[[914.46]]000 funds and syndicates now and we
[[919.26]]manage a portfolio of more than 13 000
[[925.26]]startups across all of these uh funds in
[[932.04]]Syndicate so we have a pretty deep and
[[939.84]]broad view of the industry and when we
[[946.26]]manage the in Investments for these
[[950.16]]funds and syndicates were actually the
[[954.06]]signatory on the funds so we also
[[958.2]]receive all of the deal documents for
[[962.64]]follow-on Rounds all of the cap tables
[[967.08]]all of it now of course this is being
[[970.68]]done on behalf of the funds you can
[[974.28]]effectively managing everything for the
[[979.38]]fund and so from that purview we
[[984.72]]actually do have a pretty deep
[[988.56]]understanding of what happens in
[[992.82]]adventure and we actually track on a
[[997.4]]quarterly basis
[[1003.16]]to put it really really simply the good
[[1008.72]]times and the bad times we actually have
[[1012.14]]a chart that we publish every quarter
[[1015.98]]now the rate of activity or it's
[[1019.34]]actually called the boom times and the
[[1024.44]]bad times and on this chart what we have
[[1030.98]]is the activity rate as the x-axis the
[[1035.78]]positive activity rate as the y-axis
[[1040.46]]activity rate you can think of as did
[[1045.68]]the what percentage of startups actually
[[1051.02]]had an investment right some sort of an
[[1056.18]]investment uh and the percentage
[[1060.68]]positive activity rate is what
[[1064.46]]percentage of those were actually the
[[1068.12]]upper arms so you can generally sense
[[1074.72]]that if you have a high number of
[[1080.84]]Investments and then High number of
[[1084.02]]positive activity you can have a DOT at
[[1087.62]]the top right quadrant which is Boom
[[1091.76]]times awesome right and I actually have
[[1097.7]]it up here uh and 2022 like early 2022
[[1104.06]]and 2021 is like this top right quadrant
[[1109.52]]boom times and then now it's actually at
[[1114.38]]the bottom left and it's actually one of
[[1119.3]]the worst bath times where not a lot of
[[1124.52]]startups are actually even getting an
[[1129.5]]investment and of the ones that do a
[[1134.3]]much smaller percentage actually have a
[[1138.32]]positive investment and so we're
[[1142.76]]actually in the the depth of the bear
[[1147.32]]Market if you will for Venture right now
[[1151.7]]and and that spread between where it was
[[1156.38]]in the boom times and the bad times is
[[1161.3]]the farthest distance it's ever been on
[[1166.22]]on everything that we track is it a
[[1171.02]]different time length between the like
[[1175.46]]the highest and the lowest than
[[1179.6]]traditional like when you compare back
[[1183.32]]into prior
[[1188.48]]um chasms in those two dots this is a
[[1194.72]]faster compression time frame between
[[1199.58]]those two dots it's incredibly fast and
[[1203.42]]it's actually incredible that distance
[[1206.72]]is also incredibly large so typically
[[1210.8]]when when you have these dots that
[[1214.94]]collect and it's reported every quarter
[[1218.54]]they're all kind of collect you know
[[1221.72]]pretty close to each other right it's
[[1224.48]]like okay yeah there's a little bit of
[[1229.04]]variation quarter to quarter and uh the
[[1235.1]]gap between early 2022 and right now is
[[1240.08]]like the farthest it's ever been and the
[[1245.24]]fastest it's ever uh ever contracted is
[[1249.98]]the best way to think about it but
[[1253.76]]people still say prices remain the same
[[1257.54]]especially at pre-seed and seed and
[[1261.68]]honestly I think they they are staying
[[1266.96]]the same so help me understand this
[[1272.0]]because to me as an investor day to day
[[1277.04]]they are still really high prices but
[[1281.96]]you're telling me that actually it's
[[1286.64]]never been a greater Chasm where's the
[[1290.6]]disconnect here
[[1295.58]]so the disconnect would be in the
[[1302.36]]pre-seed and Seed Market versus the
[[1308.18]]series a series B series C Market so as
[[1314.36]]we look at follow-on rounds and the uh
[[1320.12]]up rounds or down rounds those typically
[[1325.94]]happen at the series ABC onwards but and
[[1331.88]]that market is absolutely compressed
[[1335.78]]pretty significantly I mean you're
[[1339.14]]talking about deal volume in series B
[[1343.82]]down more than 50 valuations down more
[[1349.4]]than 50 percent uh series a is also down
[[1355.34]]uh seriously is basically gone right
[[1359.9]]like I mean you don't really hear of
[[1362.48]]many late stage deals getting done
[[1366.44]]anymore it's it's very it's rare
[[1371.66]]um and what's happened actually at the
[[1377.42]]precede and Seed stage is all of the
[[1382.28]]different investors that were investing
[[1385.4]]later stage some of them have started
[[1389.48]]moving earlier and earlier and so you
[[1394.76]]just have a larger number of investors
[[1400.04]]who have a lot of capital to deploy well
[[1403.94]]where are you going to go you're going
[[1407.78]]to go to pre-seed and seed and so what
[[1411.92]]you have is you have preceding seed
[[1415.58]]they're buoyed and we don't see that
[[1420.14]]changing we actually still see that
[[1424.1]]staying the same and the value shouldn't
[[1427.46]]staying the same maybe a little bit of
[[1431.0]]compression but we're not going to see
[[1435.44]]at the same rate of series a series B
[[1440.0]]and onwards which I know is in good news
[[1444.5]]for you know for for you where uh you
[[1449.42]]know it would be great for uh for
[[1453.32]]precedence evaluations to compress a
[[1456.74]]little bit but I don't think it'll
[[1460.34]]happen so I think there's also an
[[1463.88]]additional component here which is also
[[1467.72]]bluntly the chat writers at the
[[1471.86]]multi-stage funds who are writing these
[[1475.52]]pre-seed and Seed checks are actually
[[1479.36]]principles and Associates because their
[[1483.68]]partners are saying hey avoc I'm
[[1487.7]]underwater with my board positions I'm
[[1492.08]]fighting so many fires go and write two
[[1496.34]]million dollar checks and be in Market
[[1500.48]]it's good for the brand and so those new
[[1504.74]]chat Riders are less price sensitive
[[1508.58]]than ever they're more excited than ever
[[1511.76]]because they're writing their first
[[1515.36]]checks and it's creating this increased
[[1519.98]]Less Price sensitive Capital entering
[[1525.02]]seed meaning the prices are where they
[[1530.48]]are which I think is is really telling
[[1535.4]]can I ask do you not think that series a
[[1539.48]]is just a Market to be investing in
[[1544.22]]right now too as well reason being any
[[1549.26]]good companies have had everything
[[1554.66]]preempted by existings and anything not
[[1560.6]]good is out in marketing so there's this
[[1564.98]]real adverse selection are you seeing
[[1568.64]]that too in your data what we're seeing
[[1573.1]]in our data is that only the companies
[[1579.46]]that actually have credible traction are
[[1585.56]]raising now so even if you put aside
[[1589.82]]adverse selection meaning uh the set of
[[1593.12]]companies who are raising from insiders
[[1596.78]]and insiders are leading the rounds that
[[1600.38]]we're definitely seeing a set of
[[1603.32]]companies who just can't raise at all
[[1606.32]]they cannot raise a series they cannot
[[1609.26]]raise a series B and for them Capital
[[1612.8]]marks are all but shut down then you
[[1616.22]]have to look at the set of companies
[[1619.28]]where they're they're raising from
[[1623.18]]insiders or they have a new outside lead
[[1627.38]]I would say that we're not seeing
[[1630.5]]anything in our data that distinguishes
[[1633.08]]between the quality of either of those
[[1636.44]]companies now definitionally if you have
[[1639.98]]an Insider that's going to lead your
[[1643.28]]company like like a true leader I'm not
[[1646.64]]talking about an extension right of like
[[1649.22]]hey let's give you a little bit more
[[1652.1]]Runway no it's hey we're gonna we're
[[1655.82]]gonna we're gonna invest a significant
[[1659.84]]amount of capital for a little bit more
[[1663.68]]ownership in your company that that's a
[[1668.0]]real lead uh Insider lead we're not
[[1673.1]]seeing as many of those relative to the
[[1677.72]]total number of series a deals that are
[[1681.08]]getting done
[[1684.02]]um so I can't comment on the uh
[[1687.44]]distinction between the quality of those
[[1691.46]]companies since we don't see that is the
[[1695.9]]structure of seed rounds and pre-seed
[[1700.82]]rounds in terms of the invested types is
[[1706.16]]it changing is there more party rounds
[[1710.24]]because traditional institutional
[[1714.2]]investors are you know more quiet that
[[1718.22]]last party rounds because the tourists
[[1722.18]]have gone what are we seeing in terms of
[[1726.2]]the structure of those rounds let's
[[1729.68]]define party Ram if we're we're talking
[[1732.98]]about party around as no investors
[[1736.46]]writing more than 40 of the check so
[[1741.98]]there's no lead I would say that we are
[[1747.02]]seeing
[[1751.4]]um we're we're seeing the percentage of
[[1755.48]]party around to non-party around
[[1759.44]]actually being the same but the overall
[[1766.16]]volume has contracted now the set of
[[1773.48]]companies that could have raised on just
[[1778.22]]a party round
[[1782.42]]uh in terms of uh raising a little bit
[[1786.82]]of capital and not hitting their target
[[1791.02]]those are gone right so what you what
[[1795.98]]was happening in the uh the Heyday of
[[1801.74]]2021 and 2022 was that companies would
[[1806.96]]just keep raising these successive
[[1810.98]]rounds and we would see it like c c plus
[[1815.12]]C plus plus right they just keep going
[[1819.2]]on and on and on and always just raising
[[1823.34]]a little bit of capital from like these
[[1827.06]]small set of like party around investors
[[1830.6]]well that's gone we do not see that
[[1834.14]]anymore those companies literally cannot
[[1838.22]]raise anything at this point
[[1842.6]]um but we are seeing companies still
[[1847.22]]being able to raise uh from investors
[[1851.18]]where there is no lead because you do
[[1855.38]]have uh several investors all come
[[1860.06]]together to kind of create the round so
[[1865.34]]we're not seeing that lead investors are
[[1870.74]]absolutely necessary for a round to get
[[1874.22]]close especially the precedent seed
[[1877.58]]stage right you're you don't need a lot
[[1881.18]]of capital to get started and close
[[1884.18]]around
[[1887.24]]um but if you're getting to a larger
[[1890.78]]seed round right because let's keep in
[[1895.1]]mind that seed is means 2 million or 5
[[1900.26]]million there it's 2 five so two million
[[1904.94]]you can do a party round five million
[[1908.24]]it's much harder to do a party around
[[1910.64]]now so I think we have to also
[[1913.76]]distinguish between the the size of the
[[1918.56]]raise itself is the time to raise a
[[1923.18]]pre-seed or a seed round is that
[[1927.5]]increasing or is it the same so time to
[[1931.58]]raise a precedent seed is definitely
[[1936.38]]increasing also the time to markups uh
[[1942.62]]is also increasing and uh what we
[[1946.94]]actually looked at this in our data
[[1950.48]]where we looked at a sample size of the
[[1954.56]]Investments over the last 18 months and
[[1958.04]]we compared it to a sample size of the
[[1963.14]]Investments uh over time since 2015 uh
[[1968.72]]so and what we were looking at was let's
[[1973.22]]not compare it to the Heyday of 2021 and
[[1977.3]]early 2022 let's actually take a look at
[[1981.14]]historical averages so how are we doing
[[1985.88]]today relative to historical averages
[[1990.62]]and when you just take a look at that
[[1994.76]]sample size of companies from today's
[[1998.66]]Samsung companies in historical average
[[2003.1]]we're actually seeing a 33 drop in
[[2007.6]]companies in terms of how many companies
[[2012.34]]we expect would have raised by now right
[[2017.68]]and so that's a pretty significant Drop
[[2022.54]]Like 33 is high that and what that's
[[2027.64]]telling us is there is a there
[[2032.5]]definitely is a freeze in the market
[[2038.14]]relative to historical averages and
[[2045.16]]there's a lot of repricing happening and
[[2050.56]]there's a lot of um still Founders
[[2054.4]]coming to terms with the new Norm The
[[2057.64]]New Normal right I mean if you're going
[[2062.86]]to raise on 200x ARR and now all of a
[[2068.38]]sudden uh you're being told it's
[[2072.82]]actually like maybe 20 maybe 10 I mean
[[2077.08]]that's that's you're coming to terms
[[2080.92]]with brutal reality at that point and so
[[2085.72]]uh we we still think we're in the thick
[[2090.46]]of it and we think it's going to take
[[2095.74]]another few quarters before everything
[[2100.42]]just works itself out
[[2104.68]]Harry and Havelock crushing one industry
[[2109.0]]and then bringing you brutal reality
[[2113.32]]this is the positive show for you uh I
[[2118.12]]know I just I I totally agree and I see
[[2121.84]]the same thing you mentioned that kind
[[2125.2]]of crowd down to kind of deal structures
[[2130.06]]yeah in your data are you very much
[[2136.12]]seeing the repricing begin or are you
[[2141.7]]actually seeing so many companies have
[[2145.78]]so much cash that they're not needing to
[[2148.72]]come back to Market
[[2153.1]]it's the latter but it's starting we're
[[2158.86]]starting to see it so in q1 so far we've
[[2166.48]]seen 48 all right and so it's 48 flat
[[2173.86]]rounds down rounds uh these would be uh
[[2178.66]]these would be the the pay to plays pay
[[2183.46]]to plays and so we're starting to see a
[[2188.2]]tick up so it's definitely ticking up uh
[[2193.6]]from you know Q3 Q4 but we don't we
[[2199.12]]think that it's still early days and we
[[2203.14]]think it's more the latter of the
[[2206.32]]scenarios you mentioned where starps do
[[2209.8]]have a lot of cash right because if
[[2213.46]]you've raised a lot of cash
[[2217.6]]you go through layoffs you increase your
[[2222.28]]Runway so you've actually pushed out
[[2227.44]]your cash out date and so you buy a few
[[2233.26]]months right and and it's it's logical
[[2237.76]]right you're you're playing to your
[[2242.5]]incentives by a few months hey maybe uh
[[2247.6]]Jerome Powell changes his mind right
[[2251.38]]maybe they bring down the interest rates
[[2254.86]]and it'll be boom times again which I
[[2258.46]]don't think will happen uh but that's my
[[2262.66]]personal opinion and so what's happening
[[2266.56]]is the cash out date was is has been
[[2270.4]]pushed out for a lot of companies and so
[[2275.56]]our our view is that these will start
[[2282.16]]ticking up in Q2 and then definitely Q3
[[2288.82]]Q4 because these startups they have a
[[2294.22]]brick wall right investors don't really
[[2298.06]]have brick wall right yes there's a
[[2301.72]]deployment period you have to deploy by
[[2306.1]]all by a certain amount but in this
[[2310.42]]market I'm sure if fund managers can go
[[2314.86]]back to LPS and say hey I'd like to
[[2319.0]]extend the deployment period great not a
[[2322.78]]problem go for it that's much easier
[[2327.28]]than uh having a startup who does have a
[[2331.66]]cash out date and has a brick wall that
[[2335.08]]they're going to run into and so we
[[2337.96]]think that's going to start coming to
[[2341.08]]play in the next next couple of quarters
[[2344.62]]do you think we'll see a spree of
[[2348.46]]Acquisitions a consolidatory environment
[[2353.62]]occur where blood needs some of the big
[[2358.96]]incumbents pick up great teams for
[[2363.64]]nothing and you know companies can tweet
[[2367.66]]they got Acquired and want to successful
[[2371.68]]that's it and you know but no cash is
[[2376.9]]returned I I don't think so
[[2382.72]]um I I know I'm probably departing from
[[2388.24]]the conventional wisdom on this one I
[[2393.04]]don't think so because I think if you
[[2397.06]]take a look at the companies that could
[[2401.02]]be acquirers uh you have public
[[2405.1]]companies and you have private companies
[[2409.42]]with public companies they themselves
[[2414.04]]are going through a pretty brutal
[[2418.6]]um rewriting of what the new guard looks
[[2422.62]]like of what the investors are expecting
[[2427.9]]now and investors are looking at not
[[2433.66]]just the cash that your business can
[[2438.4]]generate but also your stock based
[[2443.56]]compensation So Gone are the days of
[[2449.44]]like constant you know dilution of stock
[[2454.84]]based compensation and hide it from all
[[2458.56]]of the investors that's basically how it
[[2462.64]]was being done in the public markets and
[[2466.42]]so I think they're going to be under
[[2469.3]]intense pressure and you're seeing it
[[2471.94]]you're kind of seeing it across the
[[2474.52]]board even with some of the big tech
[[2477.82]]companies so I think
[[2482.86]]um the appetite to just do rapid set of
[[2488.68]]Acquisitions uh in this market I don't
[[2493.84]]think is going to happen and then in the
[[2498.4]]private Market uh the key question
[[2502.42]]that's going to come up is what price do
[[2507.34]]you believe right uh meaning if you're a
[[2512.68]]private company and you've raised and
[[2516.46]]then there's another private company
[[2520.12]]that you're looking to acquire then the
[[2523.9]]key question comes down how do you align
[[2527.56]]on what the price is to acquire the
[[2531.7]]company so I I don't think I don't think
[[2535.54]]the conditions are there for a rapid
[[2539.4]]acquisition spree
[[2544.86]]unless these are like rock bottom prices
[[2550.9]]and it's just like you know just yeah I
[[2554.92]]mean literally you're getting an amazing
[[2558.1]]deal but I don't think that's going to
[[2562.42]]be good for employees or investors I
[[2566.02]]don't think it is good for employees or
[[2569.74]]investors but I'm saying for zero and I
[[2575.08]]still think it wouldn't happen because I
[[2579.04]]don't know many private companies that
[[2582.7]]are like yeah we just got rid of a load
[[2587.02]]of people to reduce burn but no we're
[[2591.04]]going to make this like acquisition and
[[2594.88]]bring on 21 people because the cost
[[2600.16]]isn't zero exactly it's it's it's not
[[2606.76]]zero it's also additional overhead uh
[[2612.46]]for the private company uh to take that
[[2617.86]]on because even even if you just acquire
[[2623.38]]the product or the IP even then there's
[[2628.24]]a cost of integration right and I've
[[2632.32]]been through an acquisition I've been in
[[2635.62]]the other side of an acquisition as well
[[2640.66]]and uh these are the these do take time
[[2647.14]]from the company so yeah my read on it
[[2651.58]]is we're not we're not going to see a
[[2654.76]]lot and again
[[2658.72]]um because we're the signatory for all
[[2664.84]]the funds we also see M A and uh and we
[[2670.54]]we've seen that the m a even within
[[2674.68]]Angelus data M A has gone down pretty
[[2679.32]]significantly how do you think that will
[[2684.6]]continue or change over the next six to
[[2691.66]]18 months I think it will likely stay
[[2698.08]]the same our view is actually a little
[[2703.18]]bit more pessimistic uh in terms of just
[[2708.7]]the broader Market uh so if you if we
[[2713.14]]look at the next six months I suspect
[[2717.88]]it'll be the same because the current
[[2723.58]]macro sentiment is higher interest rates
[[2728.44]]for longer so that's a lot of downward
[[2733.12]]pressure on Venture as a whole because
[[2739.42]]Venture is a risk asset uh now it's it's
[[2745.18]]a you know for some Investments it's a
[[2749.26]]great profile right you invest in you
[[2753.04]]get 10 000 X that's awesome
[[2759.82]]at the same time as a broader bucket of
[[2767.86]]capital allocation it is not it's
[[2773.38]]getting compared to earning five percent
[[2778.06]]risk free and all of a sudden a lot of
[[2781.54]]people who typically would invest in
[[2785.32]]Venture are saying maybe I'll Sprint in
[[2789.58]]U.S crusheries so I think there's a lot
[[2793.36]]of downward pressure on Venture and so
[[2796.6]]we just we don't think it's going to
[[2799.72]]change the next six months next 18
[[2803.62]]months maybe
[[2809.02]]um but you would need to see uh in the
[[2814.84]]interest rates starting to come down and
[[2819.4]]starting to see some signs of recovery
[[2822.94]]in the broader Market inflation
[[2826.48]]subsiding so I would say the summary of
[[2830.92]]what I'm saying is uh it all depends on
[[2835.9]]the macro at this point not only that in
[[2839.68]]terms of kind of you know eventually
[[2842.44]]being a risk asset class and kind of the
[[2845.86]]interest rate environment Associated but
[[2849.34]]there's also this real illiquidity
[[2854.08]]challenge within the Venture model what
[[2859.66]]are you seeing in terms of fund
[[2864.7]]secondary positions people wanting to
[[2869.68]]get out of fun positions be wanting to
[[2875.02]]sell Fun positions d defaulting what are
[[2880.36]]you seeing there when it comes to LPS
[[2885.46]]within funds we've definitely seen an
[[2891.16]]increase in appetite to sell positions
[[2896.98]]and also sometimes cell positions and
[[2901.48]]name brand you know name brand companies
[[2905.8]]are actually just great companies and
[[2912.7]]the reason to sell can range from either
[[2918.94]]the investment their own investment
[[2922.66]]ratios are off right they were just
[[2925.48]]caught on the wrong side of like
[[2929.14]]illiquid to liquid or they actually just
[[2934.0]]have a serious liquidity Crunch and
[[2937.9]]they're just looking to sell and so we
[[2941.32]]have seen an increase in it the key
[[2945.64]]question really comes down to who's the
[[2949.78]]buyer and what's the clearing price
[[2953.5]]there are deals that are getting done
[[2957.76]]and their deals are getting done not
[[2961.54]]just in small funds but also very large
[[2965.98]]funds and typically these deals happen
[[2972.1]]more in the background and typically
[[2977.74]]it's around the lp base shifting right
[[2981.94]]so when LP will purchase another LPS
[[2986.32]]position and the range of discount that
[[2990.94]]we're seeing actually is anywhere from
[[2995.74]]20 percent that but what's more common
[[3000.9]]is actually forty percent or fifty
[[3005.7]]percent from last round mark and so
[[3009.78]]you're talking about a pretty
[[3013.26]]significant discount to last round
[[3017.88]]valuation uh as the clearing price for
[[3022.8]]some of these deals and is that on
[[3026.58]]Direct deals or is that on fund
[[3031.5]]positions on fund positions okay but
[[3036.78]]that's not too bad actually I think that
[[3040.86]]sounds quite like if you actually look
[[3045.12]]at like other secondary Market data some
[[3049.62]]are as much as 60 to 70 percent down
[[3055.02]]right so I I actually almost take
[[3061.86]]positivity from 20 potentially and 50 on
[[3067.86]]a bad day so I I think that's super
[[3071.88]]interesting I think the one really
[[3075.36]]challenging segment of the kind of
[[3079.2]]funding market in terms of from a fund
[[3083.64]]manager's perspective is the microfunds
[[3088.14]]these were funds which raised from you
[[3092.94]]know Founders and you know bluntney GPS
[[3098.34]]Adventure funds which is awesome
[[3103.5]]um but they're not writing LP checks
[[3108.54]]anymore do you see that Trend and how do
[[3113.22]]you foresee the next 6 to 18 months for
[[3118.74]]the microfund segment so we we Track LP
[[3124.5]]commitments based on the type of LPN
[[3129.0]]based on the product it goes into and
[[3133.98]]and so for LPS we categorize them as
[[3138.78]]individuals and institutions
[[3143.16]]institutions are typically I'm using it
[[3147.9]]more Loosely here where it's a uh it's
[[3151.98]]there's a team around it so this could
[[3156.06]]be a small family office large family
[[3159.84]]office and then a true institution
[[3163.56]]within rolling funds uh which is one of
[[3168.18]]the products that we have uh both
[[3172.8]]individuals institutions commitments
[[3177.72]]aren't actually down by much it's close
[[3183.6]]to only 20 which is very very uh very
[[3188.28]]interesting when you compare it to
[[3192.72]]venture funds uh the adventure funds are
[[3197.58]]the traditional structure uh and we have
[[3201.38]]a pretty large Venture fund business
[[3206.08]]individuals are actually down 60 percent
[[3212.66]]from like when uh when we compare it to
[[3219.72]]uh about a a year ago so like the early
[[3224.82]]2022 when there was a significant amount
[[3228.54]]of investment still going in and
[[3232.26]]institutions uh this is actually
[[3237.18]]incredibly interesting went down
[[3243.18]]and then has in recent uh in recent
[[3248.28]]weeks spun right back up and has
[[3253.14]]recovered in our data and so that that
[[3258.12]]was the one surprise that I saw as I was
[[3263.04]]going through the data uh was that the
[[3268.5]]uh any of the folks investing in Venture
[[3274.38]]funds uh uh that are not individuals
[[3279.24]]they're starting to increase their
[[3283.5]]Investments back into Venture funds what
[[3287.28]]do you think that is do you think that's
[[3290.94]]just like a stabilization of certainty
[[3295.62]]knowing why we are being aware that
[[3299.94]]actually race will likely go up a little
[[3303.9]]bit more we're all kind of aligned on
[[3307.68]]where we think we're going out the
[[3311.58]]certainty is more there I think so I
[[3315.84]]think one part of certainty the other
[[3320.82]]part is the technology cycle we're in
[[3326.76]]which is one of the biggest technology
[[3332.82]]Cycles with AI and all of the
[[3338.1]]possibilities of what it can do in terms
[[3342.12]]of net new opportunity and rewriting
[[3346.2]]Industries and uh a lot of the large
[[3350.28]]language models and their advancements
[[3353.82]]there have had a major impact on Angelus
[[3357.24]]just our own internal operations right
[[3361.32]]it's been huge and we've been tinkering
[[3365.94]]on it for many months now and it's
[[3370.62]]actually automated a good portion of the
[[3376.74]]work that we do and so we think it's the
[[3382.02]]capital from institutions we're covering
[[3385.74]]is a function of one more a little bit
[[3389.04]]more certainty of what could be
[[3392.28]]happening in the macro market and then
[[3396.12]]also just the fact that we're in the
[[3399.48]]middle of one of the biggest technology
[[3404.1]]Cycles uh since the internet or mobile
[[3410.7]]phone and that's our hypothesis around
[[3416.1]]it I'm not going to let you just like
[[3420.24]]glaze over that but I do want to just
[[3424.44]]finish on this thread because otherwise
[[3428.58]]I get too distracted are we seeing the
[[3433.32]]number of net new funds raising go down
[[3438.06]]significantly or is the number of net
[[3442.92]]new funds same where are we at there
[[3447.6]]good question net new funds is
[[3451.5]]definitely down and so the way you
[[3455.82]]reconcile this would be Capital flows is
[[3460.38]]the funds that are raising are raising
[[3464.22]]more because they're a little bit more
[[3468.24]]experienced and they have more try more
[[3472.74]]of a track record the other interesting
[[3477.54]]data point is looking at
[[3482.22]]when does the fund raise the first
[[3486.0]]dollar of capital
[[3489.6]]and when does the fund conduct their
[[3494.76]]first close right and first close is
[[3500.7]]typically when you've raised enough and
[[3505.62]]you have confidence that you're going to
[[3511.38]]hit your fundraising Target right and uh
[[3517.26]]We've definitely seen the time to First
[[3523.02]]close has increased it was three months
[[3531.24]]uh in the boom times and now it is six
[[3538.26]]plus months and when I say six plus
[[3543.6]]months what I'm referring to is the uh
[[3549.0]]timeline it went from six and right now
[[3553.02]]it's trending towards seven and what
[[3557.88]]this means is even the uh even for the
[[3563.46]]net new GPS or funds that are raising
[[3568.56]]one we've seen an overall drop right in
[[3573.96]]terms of like how many GPS even get to
[[3577.68]]the point where they're like you know
[[3580.68]]what I can raise this font let's do it
[[3584.88]]right so we've seen a drop there but the
[[3588.96]]ones who hit that confidence of like yes
[[3593.58]]I can raise this one let's do it the
[[3598.38]]time to First close is also extended so
[[3602.7]]I they've they're taking longer to close
[[3606.3]]than they would have the first close and
[[3609.6]]they would have actually expected are we
[[3613.62]]also seeing a reduction in fun sizes for
[[3618.24]]those going out yes there is a reduction
[[3624.3]]in fund size for I would say the the
[[3631.44]]much smaller funds right in terms of if
[[3636.48]]you could raise a five million dollar
[[3640.74]]fund as your first fund you're not going
[[3644.76]]to raise that anymore it's going to be
[[3648.06]]closer to one million two million or 3
[[3652.08]]million so we're definitely seeing a
[[3656.22]]reduction in overall fund size actually
[[3660.3]]at all stages at this point but
[[3663.72]]definitely for the first time fund
[[3666.56]]manager
[[3670.96]]such a cheery topic isn't it
[[3676.46]]because you you dangled it in front of
[[3680.46]]me there in terms of bluntly how you're
[[3684.0]]leveraging Ai and llms to be more
[[3687.62]]efficient and better as an institution
[[3692.18]]too interested man what have you done
[[3698.4]]and what's been the effect so a lot of
[[3704.34]]what Angelus does in the background is
[[3710.16]]we manage everything about fun right we
[[3716.76]]manage from the initial uh legal docs or
[[3721.8]]sometimes we'll work with uh the
[[3725.58]]external Law Firm down to the fund setup
[[3730.26]]down to uh regular the filings ADV
[[3734.88]]filings uh and then managing the
[[3739.44]]portfolio for 10 years right and all the
[[3744.12]]distributions that come after that and
[[3748.68]]along the way uh when you think about
[[3752.7]]all of the different workflows it
[[3756.36]]requires judgment right there's human
[[3761.4]]judgment and so it requires humans well
[[3766.98]]with a lot of the work uh and the
[[3771.72]]advancements on large language models uh
[[3776.34]]we can start replacing right what we
[[3780.54]]assume needed human judgment to do
[[3784.26]]something you can actually now replace
[[3790.14]]with code and we've taken a subset of
[[3795.78]]things that typically required human
[[3798.66]]judgment and we've started to place
[[3802.2]]Enigma code and what one example for uh
[[3807.06]]to just to put a final point on it is we
[[3810.54]]receive
[[3813.6]]um I think it's something like 15 000
[[3817.02]]emails a week
[[3820.8]]right on behalf of all the funds and and
[[3825.3]]these are not emails you can just ignore
[[3829.68]]these are not emails that are like hey
[[3833.4]]you know we'll get back to you in a week
[[3837.48]]no no these are emails where it's hey
[[3841.68]]there's this deal getting done here's
[[3844.74]]here are the Capitals your legal docs
[[3849.3]]like review so just a simple
[[3853.98]]um process of how do you route how do
[[3858.36]]you make sure that the email gets into
[[3862.74]]the right place for the right action
[[3867.96]]right used to require a human uh to
[[3874.08]]manage and Route and apply judgment well
[[3879.24]]because we now actually have all the
[[3883.38]]training data because we've been doing
[[3886.68]]it for so long
[[3890.4]]um we essentially looked at that as one
[[3894.96]]of the problems of how do you create a
[[3900.42]]automated router but it's not as simple
[[3905.22]]as like oh email comes here and here's a
[[3908.4]]subject line you send it no you have to
[[3912.12]]actually look at the content of the
[[3916.44]]email you have to look at the contents
[[3920.88]]of the legal docs so for example if it's
[[3926.34]]a follow-on round and we're reviewing uh
[[3931.08]]the the docs in the cap table on behalf
[[3935.52]]of the fund we know that what what are
[[3940.2]]the a set of documents that we need to
[[3945.3]]complete the review and what we now do
[[3950.1]]is we'll look at the documents we'll
[[3954.24]]automatically tag is it a share purchase
[[3958.26]]agreement a cap table
[[3961.62]]Etc automatically from the documents
[[3965.04]]that we receive and then if there's a
[[3968.22]]Delta it's like oh actually this is
[[3972.24]]missing a cap table well we now know hey
[[3977.22]]we respond back and automatically just
[[3981.06]]ask hey we're messing the cap table can
[[3985.62]]you send it and so that's just one very
[[3992.34]]small example of how we're using it and
[[3998.16]]we're in a fortunate position that we've
[[4001.94]]just been building up all this training
[[4006.32]]over the last over the last five you
[[4011.06]]know five to six years of just doing
[[4016.34]]this at scale and uh so when when we
[[4021.08]]started tinkering with this we're like
[[4024.8]]oh this is awesome we we could actually
[[4029.18]]just use this and start applying it
[[4032.78]]right away have look I mentioned before
[[4036.14]]we started that I'm more direct with my
[[4039.5]]questions nowadays
[[4044.48]]um that would lead to cost reduction
[[4049.76]]um it would lead to cost efficiency and
[[4054.44]]and bluntly increase productivity within
[[4058.7]]the team
[[4062.9]]um I I think I saw recently in a group
[[4067.82]]someone having a moan about Angelus
[[4073.96]]pricing for managers going way up
[[4077.94]]help me kind of coincide the two which
[[4082.98]]is like increase productivity usage of
[[4088.86]]AI to make costs lower and then pricing
[[4093.96]]going up I think what that's referring
[[4101.04]]to is the pricing uh update we made on
[[4110.82]]funds that are larger sized funds and if
[[4117.6]]we think about the journey Angeles has
[[4121.92]]been on it's typically been a it's a
[[4125.58]]very different Journey from most fund
[[4128.4]]administrators
[[4132.42]]um and most fun back office platforms
[[4138.06]]and the journey we've been on is
[[4144.42]]we've actually built software to help
[[4149.88]]automate a lot of what it takes to
[[4153.0]]manage a fund all the way down to
[[4156.42]]financial reporting tax reporting Etc
[[4161.52]]and when we when we launched the fun
[[4166.62]]product which I believe was in 2017 the
[[4170.4]]very first fun product it was like a
[[4173.58]]tiny fun it was kind of like an offshoot
[[4177.36]]of an SPV and it could only do like a
[[4180.66]]million dollars because that was the
[[4184.32]]simplest thing we could do all right and
[[4188.52]]what we have to do is over the years
[[4192.36]]build more and more software to get more
[[4196.02]]and more support more and more complex
[[4199.5]]funds more more complex parameters like
[[4204.3]]carry hurdles cashless contributions oh
[[4208.5]]I'm sure you've been through all of this
[[4211.98]]right all those little details well to
[[4217.2]]do that in software it takes time and so
[[4222.48]]our the path we've been on is every year
[[4227.22]]you can actually chart uh and we've done
[[4231.72]]this the size of the funds we take on
[[4235.08]]and every year it keeps increase and
[[4238.56]]keeps increasing keeps increasing uh and
[[4244.02]]so today uh we're regularly taking on 50
[[4250.02]]100 200 million dollar funds whereas two
[[4254.28]]years ago we were saying no to all of
[[4257.28]]them right they were coming in but we
[[4260.16]]said hey we just cannot take you on
[[4263.64]]because we can't credibly serve you for
[[4268.98]]the next 10 years because we have a very
[[4274.32]]strong eye towards software and
[[4279.0]]automation to handle all of the
[[4283.56]]um in all of the portfolio management uh
[[4287.7]]distributions Etc over the years and so
[[4293.64]]the pricing change that we made was a
[[4299.58]]function of taking pricing that was
[[4303.48]]actually meant for that was actually
[[4307.2]]meant for funds that were like two and a
[[4311.04]]half million three million five million
[[4315.06]]right from a couple years ago and there
[[4319.56]]was a pricing cap that was set it was
[[4324.6]]like you know you're I I believe is one
[[4328.74]]percent a year
[[4333.12]]capped at 25k a year which effectively
[[4338.58]]caps it at 250k overall right and that's
[[4343.02]]for everything we handle tax uh
[[4347.04]]financial reporting all of it and all
[[4351.0]]what we really did was we said well the
[[4354.9]]fund size we've taken on has kept
[[4358.74]]increasing and we never removed the cap
[[4361.86]]because that cap was meant for much
[[4365.52]]smaller funds and it was uh the change
[[4370.02]]that we made was mostly just removing
[[4374.04]]the cap and then right sizing it to like
[[4377.88]]the size of the funds uh so if you
[[4381.84]]actually take a look at the fund size
[[4386.4]]relative to what it costs today it's
[[4392.1]]actually similar and so I think some of
[[4397.68]]that is just our own I think the way we
[[4402.06]]rolled out the pricing probably caused a
[[4405.84]]little bit of confusion is it a lost
[[4410.4]]leader yeah I I've obviously been a
[[4415.8]]wonderful customer and and user Angel
[[4420.72]]list and it's amazing but I look at my
[[4425.96]]guy they cannot be making money
[[4431.36]]I mean it noisy but it's a great service
[[4438.12]]and it's not that expensive yeah so like
[[4444.6]]for those small funds is that a lost
[[4448.92]]leader when you look at the 25k days a
[[4452.58]]year and all that you're doing what are
[[4456.96]]the margins on that yeah it's it's not a
[[4462.36]]loss leader a lot of the automation that
[[4467.64]]we've built in and that's also also
[[4472.98]]continuing to come in keeps expanding
[[4478.14]]those margins and so anything around
[[4482.76]]funds is definitely not a loss leader
[[4487.5]]for us and uh where we continue to see
[[4492.96]]the margins around that increase and the
[[4497.1]]other the other way we actually think
[[4501.06]]about it is we think about the entire
[[4505.68]]business as a whole not just not
[[4509.1]]necessarily on a specific product
[[4512.82]]because when we think about a GP or we
[[4516.6]]think about an LP we think about it as
[[4520.26]]hey you should just come to Angelus and
[[4523.74]]we'll handle everything all of your
[[4526.62]]needs are on Venture going forward so
[[4530.28]]for a GP it's all their funds all their
[[4533.94]]spvs okay great they're gonna go raise
[[4537.12]]Angeles Capital right we have a business
[[4540.78]]model run Angeles capital and when
[[4544.62]]you're a financial platform they're all
[[4548.64]]of these other different ways of uh
[[4552.54]]capturing more and more value as you
[[4557.22]]scale and so the way we look at margins
[[4563.22]]are actually more holistically over for
[[4568.56]]the entire product experience uh so all
[[4572.28]]the products GPS would use all the
[[4576.42]]products LPS would be used versus on any
[[4581.76]]single product and so our margins are
[[4586.98]]actually north of 80 percent when you
[[4590.7]]actually took a look at the overall
[[4593.82]]experience uh and you take a look at
[[4597.84]]overall products that customers are
[[4602.82]]using and so again this is the this is
[[4608.82]]the key around a platform play right if
[[4614.82]]you're doing just only a SAS play it's a
[[4619.26]]little bit different when you have a
[[4623.7]]platform play you actually have products
[[4628.26]]that can feed into other products that
[[4632.16]]can feed into other products and I
[[4636.18]]actually learned a lot of this in my
[[4640.08]]time at Square so Square had acquired
[[4644.52]]fast byte that's actually how Gokul and
[[4648.78]]I started working together and when I
[[4652.34]]joined Square was
[[4657.02]]basically just the payments dongle and
[[4663.36]]in my time there I saw how Square went
[[4669.24]]from a payments dongle to a platform
[[4673.86]]where you would literally have one
[[4677.28]]product that feeds into another that
[[4680.04]]feeds into another that feeds into
[[4683.94]]another and you get this compound effect
[[4689.16]]of pretty rapid Revenue growth rapid
[[4695.34]]revenue or gross margin expansion and so
[[4701.22]]I I definitely took a lot of the lessons
[[4706.68]]from there and applied it at Angelus man
[[4712.26]]I'm loving this what Angelus product has
[[4716.52]]the best margin today and what has the
[[4722.1]]worst I would say funds have the best
[[4730.08]]margins and the smaller spvs have the
[[4735.26]]worst
[[4739.4]]and for some of the smaller sbvs those
[[4744.42]]are a loss leader for us
[[4748.44]]and this shouldn't be a surprise for
[[4753.66]]anyone paying attention we saw a sure
[[4759.36]]which was an SPV provider effectively
[[4765.66]]blow up completely and they blew up in a
[[4772.02]]spectacular fashion they basically had
[[4777.0]]took money in from all the spvs that
[[4781.14]]they were supposed to manage over six
[[4786.42]]years or ten years and uh when they blew
[[4790.68]]up they're like hey we don't actually
[[4793.92]]have any money left and so all the GPS
[[4798.6]]were now left to fend for themselves in
[[4802.98]]terms of well how are you going to get
[[4807.18]]the money today manage all the sbvs for
[[4812.76]]all the out years and the the the the
[[4817.32]]key
[[4820.38]]um learning there and we already knew
[[4823.62]]this with the key learning there for
[[4827.94]]other folks in the industry is that spvs
[[4833.16]]and managing these spvs and especially
[[4838.68]]the smaller ones it looks easy at the
[[4844.08]]outset it looks easy to set up it's like
[[4848.58]]oh how hard is it to accept LP Capital
[[4853.26]]how hard is it to close this spvian
[[4857.34]]invest in the company that's great
[[4862.56]]but what they're missing is that a lot
[[4868.32]]of the surprises actually happen in the
[[4872.76]]out years right it's one of those like
[[4878.52]]tail issues and it's not that uh the
[[4884.52]]spvs and the Taylor system of the spvs
[[4889.26]]is like you know only a small percentage
[[4894.0]]it's more about what could what could
[[4898.32]]happen that could be really costly for
[[4902.34]]the company and so it can actually Wipe
[[4905.88]]Out the margins of a larger group of
[[4911.16]]spvs and so generally I think most
[[4917.04]]people get surprised by the margin
[[4920.76]]profile of sbbs and especially small
[[4925.68]]spvs and I see this with GPS sometimes
[[4930.78]]uh it doesn't happen as much anymore I
[[4934.38]]think a sure going out of business was a
[[4938.0]]pretty big wake-up call for the industry
[[4944.0]]but sometimes I'll see GPS ask about hey
[[4950.1]]like why is it so expensive Why Can't
[[4953.84]]This be even lower and lower and lower
[[4959.42]]and uh my my response typically is hey
[[4965.1]]these are complex financial instruments
[[4969.36]]that need to be managed for 10 years and
[[4973.68]]it's not the place you actually want to
[[4978.06]]be optimizing on costs at all because
[[4982.32]]it's one of those things where when it's
[[4985.62]]just working in the background you have
[[4988.8]]someone you know some incredible that
[[4992.7]]can run it you never have to worry about
[[4996.78]]it but as soon as you're dealing with a
[[5001.7]]provider who's using cost and price as a
[[5006.74]]way to get you in you should stop and
[[5010.52]]ask them and think about why are they
[[5014.3]]doing that anyways I'll pause there it
[[5017.66]]looks like you have another question I I
[[5020.9]]mean I have so many what products have
[[5024.8]]you done that with the benefit of
[[5029.24]]hindsight you shouldn't have done we got
[[5035.24]]into incorporation for startups and
[[5042.02]]that's when we ran that for a while
[[5047.48]]and in hindsight
[[5051.38]]and we fix it we actually just partnered
[[5055.4]]with stripe Atlas and that's been great
[[5060.2]]in hindsight I think we would have
[[5065.3]]approached it by asking the question
[[5071.06]]is this something unique that angelist
[[5077.0]]can bring to the world right is there
[[5081.32]]something unique about this problem and
[[5084.38]]unique about our view of how to solve it
[[5087.32]]that we can bring to the world and bring
[[5089.78]]to the table
[[5093.62]]and if not then it doesn't make sense
[[5098.5]]for us to be doing it why do another
[[5103.66]]product where we can contribute
[[5108.38]]something new and novel that people are
[[5112.1]]going to find really useful
[[5116.48]]and I wouldn't have in hindsight I
[[5121.22]]wouldn't have tackled that if we'd asked
[[5126.08]]that question now something like rubs
[[5130.4]]which have obviously been a huge success
[[5134.72]]was something where we had a very unique
[[5140.54]]view of the world that yes rev should
[[5145.88]]exist Angelus is very uniquely suited to
[[5151.1]]do it we're very good at the overlap of
[[5157.24]]legal Innovation product experience
[[5162.94]]founder tools and so we did it and it's
[[5169.04]]been great why not Europe Europe seems
[[5174.68]]to be a a kind of Shadow region for
[[5178.82]]Angel list and there's so much demand
[[5182.96]]for it in Europe what's Angel lists
[[5188.42]]thoughts around Europe so when I came in
[[5194.18]]Angeles was in Europe right we actually
[[5200.26]]had a few funds that were there
[[5207.12]]and after I sat with the Euro business
[[5213.46]]for a few quarters
[[5219.62]]the observation I had was we hadn't won
[[5224.6]]us yet
[[5230.42]]and we weren't at scale in the US
[[5238.88]]but we were in Europe and the regulatory
[[5244.76]]structures in Europe that we need to
[[5249.74]]solve were not as standardized as they
[[5255.92]]would be in the U.S and so it was the
[[5261.56]]combination of look we need to let's win
[[5266.9]]U.S first U.S is also just the largest
[[5272.84]]market for venture and and then let's
[[5278.54]]make sure we have a clear view of how we
[[5281.96]]can standardize a structure in Europe
[[5285.14]]and then we can go there
[[5289.04]]and so I actually made the decision to
[[5293.84]]scale back and shut down Europe
[[5298.28]]um because it was just splitting our
[[5302.3]]resources and the one thing I deeply
[[5307.4]]believe is you should always always look
[[5312.74]]at how do you how do you Sunset things
[[5317.48]]like you you I think I think it makes
[[5320.9]]sense for a company to explore new
[[5324.44]]products and new expansion but if it's
[[5328.46]]not working at the rate you expect it to
[[5333.8]]Let's Sunset we've got to focus back on
[[5339.02]]the core and so that move was more about
[[5343.16]]us focusing back on the core around
[[5348.5]]winning U.S scaling us because the
[[5354.44]]ambition of the team is very large and
[[5359.96]]we didn't want to get distracted by
[[5364.46]]these uh you know by kind of solve for
[[5368.24]]the regulatory structure there when we
[[5371.78]]hadn't won the US yet I think now we're
[[5374.54]]actually in a very different position
[[5378.26]]what does winning the US mean winning
[[5384.38]]the US for us is what percentage of
[[5390.32]]venture funds are we supporting
[[5394.46]]and what percentage of venture-backed
[[5397.22]]startups are we supporting on our
[[5400.7]]infrastructure and so we look at it
[[5406.04]]simply as percentage of market share and
[[5412.4]]we want to be north of 50 across all of
[[5418.4]]the different segments as we scale and
[[5422.96]]it's as simple as that what are we today
[[5427.7]]in terms of funds and companies it's uh
[[5434.0]]so companies we we just started uh last
[[5439.94]]year with our Capital product and uh
[[5444.8]]it's grown quite fast uh I can't share
[[5449.72]]market share data yet but it is growing
[[5454.58]]incredibly fast uh and we're very very
[[5458.78]]happy uh with with that and we're
[[5462.98]]continuing to invest there on the fun
[[5468.26]]side anytime we enter a particular fund
[[5473.78]]like size we go after it we'll typically
[[5479.96]]get north of uh 50 market share pretty
[[5485.54]]quickly and so that's how to think about
[[5489.68]]it's like 50 60 market share as we kind
[[5493.9]]of eat into the different funds because
[[5498.76]]again our product is just fundamentally
[[5504.44]]different than any other back office
[[5509.36]]provider you mentioned the cap table
[[5514.88]]product envelope yeah and I kind of swim
[[5520.52]]for the warning sign
[[5526.16]]um it's kind of like uh I mean a well as
[[5531.86]]to be blunt it's like a on Direct
[[5536.66]]competitive courser how do you think
[[5541.52]]about competition what's the right way
[[5546.08]]to embrace it and bluntly how have you
[[5551.3]]been able very quickly to catch up and
[[5556.46]]level with them in such a short space of
[[5559.34]]time
[[5562.82]]so the way we think about competition is
[[5567.92]]really having an eye towards competition
[[5571.7]]but we're not really focused on the
[[5575.78]]competition there's actually this great
[[5581.36]]quote I think it's from YC but it may be
[[5586.34]]somewhere else where startups die of
[[5592.1]]suicide not homicide and I've believed
[[5597.32]]that for every single company and
[[5600.5]]candidly have you know my first company
[[5605.18]]died by Suicide I basically killed it it
[[5610.76]]had nothing to competition and so as we
[[5615.14]]think about running ageless and the
[[5618.32]]products we build
[[5622.34]]we really stay focused on
[[5627.44]]how are we delivering an amazing
[[5632.72]]experience for our customers and what
[[5637.28]]makes sense for us to pursue and grow
[[5641.12]]regardless of the competition regardless
[[5644.96]]of you know whatever market share
[[5649.7]]someone may already have and if we think
[[5654.74]]that we have a unique view on something
[[5658.34]]and we can create a significantly better
[[5662.68]]product experience we will just go do it
[[5670.06]]and the thing we have working for us is
[[5677.72]]we are very product focused we are a
[[5683.36]]team of pretty ambitious tinkerers
[[5688.94]]product Builders and we move incredibly
[[5694.64]]fast once we're clear on the direction
[[5699.14]]and so I I don't really think about
[[5703.88]]competition in terms of focusing on it I
[[5708.74]]think about it more as how do we build
[[5713.0]]something amazing for our customers with
[[5717.5]]an eye towards a competition meaning you
[[5721.82]]know you can't just ignore competition
[[5725.3]]um but that's more of a secondary thing
[[5729.14]]our main focus is on building an amazing
[[5733.88]]product and just you know owning that
[[5738.44]]market are you taking customers from
[[5742.76]]Corsa or are these net new companies
[[5745.82]]created
[[5749.24]]what's that spread it's all of the above
[[5754.88]]uh we are we're definitely uh taking on
[[5760.46]]net new customers we're taking on
[[5764.42]]customers that are using other providers
[[5768.56]]uh and so we are just sucking in
[[5772.76]]companies and customers from everywhere
[[5775.94]]at this point you mentioned about being
[[5779.36]]a team in product anchors I tweeted this
[[5783.02]]but I I think it's something that Goku
[[5788.0]]shares which is an awe around the speed
[[5793.52]]of execution with which Angel is takes
[[5798.32]]the keys what do you what do you do to
[[5802.82]]be able to execute on new products so
[[5806.36]]fast because it is faster than anyone
[[5808.76]]else
[[5812.48]]what do you do to enable that speed I
[[5817.7]]think the most important thing we do is
[[5822.14]]we've hired a group of very ambitious
[[5827.0]]people a group of ambitious people are
[[5832.1]]very dissatisfied all the time right
[[5836.96]]like all the time it's like hey why
[[5840.98]]aren't we there yet like why aren't we
[[5844.58]]building something even larger bigger so
[[5848.3]]that's a number one ingredient just hire
[[5851.86]]a group of incredibly ambitious
[[5856.36]]dissatisfied people all the time which
[[5862.16]]is great from there we just set a very
[[5867.8]]clear and ambitious deadlines right
[[5872.18]]product launch timelines
[[5876.32]]and the last piece is just keeping a
[[5881.18]]very tight Loop between the working team
[[5886.28]]and just making sure that if there are
[[5890.66]]any blockers anything coming up just
[[5894.92]]address it and then let's just get the
[[5898.82]]product out let's not have meetings
[[5902.06]]about meetings or process about process
[[5905.96]]now that matters right the only
[[5910.64]]purpose for a a company it's just a
[[5914.6]]group of individuals that came that are
[[5917.72]]coming together to build product for
[[5922.22]]your customers and any process anything
[[5926.96]]that gets in the way of that crush it if
[[5930.5]]we have too many meetings cancel the
[[5933.5]]meetings like I'll regularly go cancel
[[5936.86]]all my meetings on the calendar because
[[5941.24]]all that really matters is that you're
[[5945.14]]shipping products that your customers
[[5947.72]]love
[[5950.66]]and anything that gets in the way of
[[5955.28]]that and you drag kill it crush it and
[[5961.58]]just focus on speed focus on getting the
[[5966.98]]iterations with your customers focus on
[[5970.58]]getting that feedback so that that's how
[[5974.48]]we think about shipping really quickly
[[5978.32]]what do you think are the biggest
[[5983.18]]external threats to you achieving
[[5989.54]]winning the US market final one the
[[5995.3]]biggest external threat I actually don't
[[6000.28]]think we're in that anymore I was gonna
[[6006.16]]say I I never I never underestimate a
[[6010.72]]group of
[[6014.5]]you know a small group of really
[[6018.88]]ambitious individuals and I would say
[[6022.12]]the biggest external threat would just
[[6026.56]]be anyone that's looking to compete with
[[6032.02]]Angelus that's a startup but I've always
[[6036.58]]been like that I'm I'm pretty paranoid
[[6040.54]]when it comes to what small teams right
[[6044.32]]how would you respond to the suggestion
[[6049.36]]that the macro sentiment is your biggest
[[6053.86]]stats Donald threat if you think about
[[6057.58]]angel list it is and your trajectory in
[[6062.2]]your transaction volume is predicated on
[[6065.74]]the amount of deals done the amount of
[[6068.98]]funds close the amount of spv's done
[[6074.14]]when the market shrinks and cadences
[[6079.78]]reduced massively your business is
[[6085.0]]damaged no it actually isn't it actually
[[6090.52]]is the strongest it's ever been again it
[[6096.46]]goes back to the platform play that we
[[6100.48]]have
[[6104.26]]and how we have the you know how we're
[[6108.64]]actually continuing to move up Market
[[6112.78]]take larger and larger funds and so
[[6117.7]]while net new fund creation may have
[[6122.26]]gone down we're actually taking on funds
[[6127.54]]who have already fundraised and deployed
[[6132.7]]right we're not just we're not just
[[6136.72]]going live with funds that are net new
[[6139.96]]we're also going live with funds who are
[[6143.38]]moving to angelist after they've already
[[6147.4]]been somewhere else right so we're
[[6151.24]]effect you can think of Angelus as just
[[6155.56]]continuing to grab more and more market
[[6160.3]]share and it's not dependent on net new
[[6164.8]]funds the way we actually generate
[[6169.06]]revenue is we actually have all these
[[6172.24]]different products that feed on each
[[6174.7]]other and so we're actually the
[[6178.48]]strongest we've ever been and Angelus
[[6183.04]]has always run as if the next bear
[[6186.4]]markets around the corner literally
[[6189.7]]every year that I've been at it until
[[6194.26]]it's we've always said oh you know what
[[6198.4]]the next bear Market is going to be next
[[6201.58]]year so we have to make sure we have
[[6206.08]]counter cyclical products in place and
[[6211.48]]we diversify the product portfolio and
[[6217.6]]every year uh since uh since uh mid 2019
[[6222.82]]and we're like yep next bear Market's
[[6226.3]]coming next bear Market's coming and so
[[6229.72]]we've actually always been paranoid by
[[6232.96]]the next big bear market so we actually
[[6237.7]]built in counter cyclical motions in the
[[6242.62]]company as well but yeah it's the
[[6246.52]]strongest ever been we are we are
[[6250.84]]absolutely firing on all cylinders right
[[6255.7]]now we have a a series of new products
[[6260.8]]coming I'll just tease that here it's uh
[[6265.24]]it's coming in the next uh in in the
[[6268.9]]next couple of months and not just one
[[6272.5]]it'll be a few but you want to give a
[[6276.94]]teaser do you only give one not not yet
[[6281.94]]it's uh
[[6286.98]]it was a moment I was thinking I was
[[6292.54]]thinking that I I'm very excited I'm
[[6298.06]]very excited um but not yet I was about
[[6302.68]]to and I'm like ah no Bruce is gonna
[[6306.42]]kill me
[[6310.44]]for trying I want to do a quick fire
[[6314.2]]around Havelock so I say a short
[[6316.96]]statement you give me your immediate
[[6319.9]]thoughts we mentioned the macro there
[[6323.62]]will we be in a worse or a better place
[[6329.08]]at the end of 2023 I think worse but I
[[6334.42]]think it'll get better in 2024. what
[[6338.2]]trend do you see that others are not
[[6342.52]]seeing I think people are seeing this
[[6346.3]]um I just don't think they're seeing the
[[6350.14]]the rate of change which is the rate of
[[6356.08]]change uh through which AI will actually
[[6361.72]]uh completely uh not decimate but
[[6366.04]]amplify knowledge work but I do think
[[6369.76]]there will be a lot of reskilling a lot
[[6373.72]]of retraining needed and it's getting
[[6379.12]]deployed extremely fast across many many
[[6384.1]]Industries and so I would say the
[[6387.16]]biggest friend others aren't seeing is
[[6390.52]]just the magnitude of the change that's
[[6395.14]]coming for White Collar work who are
[[6399.82]]best place to instill that change is it
[[6404.32]]incumbents integrating AI into existing
[[6408.76]]product Suites or startups providing new
[[6412.6]]products I think starters providing new
[[6416.86]]products and I think it's because the
[[6422.26]]quality of the team of like the product
[[6427.6]]craft right or or the the team that's
[[6431.26]]going to care about the product the most
[[6434.38]]typically comes from the founders and
[[6438.34]]the founding team to bring together so I
[[6442.06]]think they're going to be most suited
[[6447.16]]that said incumbents do have you know a
[[6451.84]]lot of advantages distribution
[[6454.54]]advantages being one of the biggest ones
[[6458.38]]so I wouldn't count out any incumbent as
[[6462.94]]we've definitely seen but I I personally
[[6466.78]]lean more towards startups being able to
[[6470.92]]capture a lot of value I love Alex Ron
[[6475.84]]Pals you know will the incumbent acquire
[[6480.4]]innovation before the startup requires
[[6484.48]]distribution I think to that the whole
[[6488.92]]time actually okay my friend you can buy
[[6494.26]]one multi-stage firm and you can short
[[6499.84]]one multi-stage firm which ones you buy
[[6504.16]]which one do you short
[[6509.2]]uh Sequoia to buy multi-stage firm no
[[6514.42]]comment on shorting
[[6518.76]]you can buy one seed stage like
[[6524.4]]specialist and you can short
[[6530.64]]one seeds data specialist go sea stage
[[6536.34]]specialized Haystack um I would buy and
[[6541.38]]then short also no comment on that one
[[6547.2]] one day I'm gonna get someone just
[[6552.14]]be like very good I don't care
[[6556.46]]I need someone who's like retired and
[[6560.82]]just doesn't give a it's gonna be a
[[6564.72]]curmudgeon and maybe catch me in a
[[6567.9]]couple years I'll maybe I'll be a
[[6571.44]]commercial what did you believe in
[[6575.52]]investing that you no longer believe
[[6578.94]]that
[[6584.1]]a great team can go find a market and
[[6590.4]]find a great Market I actually think you
[[6595.08]]need a great team and a great Market to
[[6597.96]]come together
[[6601.44]]uh otherwise you just have a great team
[[6605.94]]that can burn a lot of Cycles on a
[[6611.28]]market that is just utterly broken and
[[6616.98]]I've seen this time and time again uh
[[6621.12]]and uh that's the one thing I think a
[[6624.72]]lot about now is what Market are they
[[6629.58]]going after and I don't I and look I
[[6633.72]]think I think there's some Founders
[[6637.62]]getting that can pivot and find it but
[[6641.76]]that assumes that they'll have enough
[[6645.54]]capital in the bank to go do it now it's
[[6650.34]]exactly the same for me like 100 if you
[[6655.26]]are going after uh something really
[[6659.88]] hot consumer education market
[[6663.96]]and you're raising 18 months of Runway
[[6668.34]]surely maybe the world's best team but
[[6672.42]]you're going to take 12 months to get to
[[6675.42]]that realization place and then you're
[[6679.26]]gonna raise again or need to with
[[6683.58]]nothing but again a good team that's a
[[6688.32]]hard another race exactly I'm touching
[[6693.48]]this environment now totally with you
[[6697.38]]what do you think the biggest investment
[[6700.92]]mistake of the Venture landscape was
[[6704.46]]when looking back over the last 18
[[6709.2]]months oh that simple lack of diligence
[[6714.06]]in the companies that they're investing
[[6718.02]]in there was a lot of fomo investing
[[6722.94]]that happened in the uh in the uh in in
[[6728.16]]the heydays what would you most like to
[[6733.14]]change about the world of LPS I think
[[6738.72]]with LPS there is a lot of focus and
[[6743.16]]especially larger LPS there's a lot of
[[6747.96]]focus on name brand and I the key thing
[[6754.38]]I would change is uh breaking out of
[[6759.66]]that cycle of only name brand and
[[6764.64]]actually looking at other signals and it
[[6769.08]]reminds me a lot of what we do as a
[[6771.96]]society and when we look at someone
[[6775.68]]graduate from Harvard uh or Stanford
[[6779.88]]right there's a lot of uh brain
[[6784.5]]signaling and I think that has a place
[[6789.72]]but when we look at our data first on
[[6794.58]]fund managers are fantastic right not
[[6799.02]]all of them but when you think when you
[[6802.14]]look at some of the returns they can be
[[6805.32]]great so if you have a different way of
[[6808.68]]diligencing first-time fund managers I
[[6811.68]]think it's an awesome way to invest in
[[6815.46]]fact ILP into first-time fund managers
[[6819.42]]all the time I'm like yep you're going
[[6822.36]]to be super hungry and you're going to
[[6826.02]] crush it so let's let's let's do
[[6831.06]]it will Trump win the election
[[6836.82]]I don't think so who will I hope not
[[6843.06]]Biden either I I hope we get I hope we
[[6847.86]]just get a different candidate a more
[[6851.58]]sensible candidate
[[6855.36]]um but the way it's trending right now
[[6859.68]]it is not looking right who's your
[[6863.88]]favorite angel to work with them why
[[6867.72]]then Google is actually my favorite
[[6874.14]]angel to work with and why him uh I
[[6880.04]]think he's
[[6885.86]]incredibly sharp and understands all of
[[6892.62]]the life cycles of a company from the
[[6897.54]]idea stage now how do you actually scale
[[6901.32]]it and become one of the endurance
[[6905.94]]companies and Google is one of the few
[[6911.7]]uh that actually has experience in not
[[6915.72]]just starve stage but also building an
[[6919.02]]endurance company and being part of it
[[6923.64]]final one my friend Angel list in 10
[[6929.1]]years what is it then I think on the
[[6935.28]]current trajectory uh we will be uh the
[[6941.34]]infrastructure for all venture funds uh
[[6945.74]]for a lot of adventure-backed startups
[[6950.06]]and will just be the fabric Adventure
[[6954.24]]that's how we think about it it's one of
[[6958.08]]those things where all the activity that
[[6962.28]]happens in Venture investing ownership
[[6966.54]]management is just rather than being
[[6970.44]]done in spreadsheets and offline it's
[[6974.94]]all done in software on Angelus do you
[[6979.86]]think Angelus will be a public company I
[[6983.1]]don't know we don't actually think a lot
[[6987.3]]about uh going public we we just stay
[[6992.82]]focused on how do we build an enduring
[[6998.34]]company uh with large cash flows at
[[7002.66]]compounds that's how I think about it
[[7006.44]]from a pure quantitative lens that's
[[7010.46]]really all we focus on is how do we just
[[7015.08]]build an enduring large company that we
[[7019.7]]would be proud of
[[7023.42]]I've looked I was so appreciated yeah
[[7028.46]]your patience with me just peppering you
[[7033.2]]um it's been so much fun so thank you so
[[7037.1]]much for joining me yeah nice has been
[[7041.56]]great thank you
