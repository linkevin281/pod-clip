[[0]]you know ignoring Tech uh is kind of no
[[5.2]]longer an option in the government big
[[11.08]]Tech has been pres in Washington but big
[[17.28]]Tech's interests are not only very
[[22.36]]different than kind of startup
[[28.24]]Innovation innovators interests but we
[[34.92]]think also kind of Divergent from
[[40.4]]America's interest as a whole you know
[[45.2]]if America is going to be America in the
[[51.32]]next 100 years we have to get this right
[[57.92]]y
[[60.92]][Music]
[[67.04]]welcome back everybody uh we are very
[[70.52]]excited for this episode um we are going
[[74.32]]to be discussing a lot of hot topics the
[[79.32]]uh theme of today's show um is Tech and
[[85.8]]policy and politics um and so um there's
[[90.64]]you know just a tremendous amount of
[[94.32]]heat right now uh in the tech World
[[97.92]]about politics there's a tremendous
[[100.32]]amount of heat in the political world
[[105.12]]about tech um and then we as a firm
[[110.28]]actually I and Ben both Ben and I as
[[112.92]]individuals have been spending a lot
[[115.72]]more time in in in policy and politics
[[119.52]]circles over the last several months um
[[123.64]]and we as a firm have a much bigger push
[[126.96]]here than we used to which which Ben
[[130.68]]will describe um in a moment uh but
[[134.0]]we're going to go into quite a bit of
[[136.8]]detail um the big disclaimer that we
[[140.96]]want to provide Upfront for this is that
[[146.36]]uh we are a nonpartisan firm um we are
[[152.24]]100% focused on Tech politics and policy
[[157.8]]um we today in this uh episode are going
[[163.76]]to be describing um uh a fair number of
[[168.24]]topics some of which which involve
[[172.96]]partisan politics um our goal um is to
[[178.72]]describe anything that is partisan as
[[183.8]]accurately as possible um and to kind of
[[187.52]]you know try to be as sort of
[[190.0]]fair-minded and representing multiple
[[193.08]]points of view as we can be we are we
[[196.08]]are going to try very hard to not take
[[199.28]]any sort of personal political uh
[[202.76]]partisan position so ple please if you
[[206.72]]could get grant us uh some generosity of
[[211.0]]interpretation in what we say we are
[[215.2]]trying to describe and explain um as
[[219.76]]opposed to uh advocate for anything
[[225.4]]specifically partisan uh we advocate for
[[230.6]]policy topics we we did not Advocate uh
[[235.32]]for for for other partisan topics um and
[[239.96]]actually so yeah on that theme Ben um
[[243.4]]could you uh you know we we wrote a
[[246.76]]little while ago you wrote a blog post
[[251.84]]uh about and published about the our
[[257.68]]firm's engagement in politics and policy
[[262.0]]uh we sort of laid out our goals and and
[[265.16]]and then also how we're going about it
[[268.16]]and we're actually we are actually quite
[[272.24]]transparent about this um and so hoping
[[276.08]]maybe as an introduction for people who
[[278.68]]haven't seen that if you could walk
[[281.28]]through uh what you know what our plan
[[283.92]]of strategy is and how we think about
[[287.8]]this yeah kind of starts with you know
[[292.68]]why now you know why why get involved in
[[297.96]]politics now um you know historically
[[302.92]]Tech has been a little involved in
[[306.28]]politics but it's been relatively
[[311.68]]obscure issues H1B visas um stock option
[[318.68]]accounting uh carried interest things
[[324.2]]like that H but now the issues are much
[[329.96]]more mainstream and it turns out that
[[335.64]]you know for most of kind of the
[[341.4]]software Industries like um you know
[[346.48]]Washington just hasn't been that
[[350.76]]interested in Tech or in regulating tech
[[356.04]]for the most part uh but starting kind
[[362.16]]of in the mid 2000s uh as self rate the
[[368.04]]world and Tech started to invade all
[[374.0]]aspects of life um you know ignoring
[[380.28]]Tech uh is kind of no longer an option
[[385.4]]in the government uh and that you know
[[389.88]]they've seen it impact elections and
[[394.48]]education and everything and they you
[[400.64]]know uh I think policy makers really
[[406.96]]want to get in front of it is term that
[[411.08]]we hear a lot you know we need to be in
[[415.08]]front of these things this time not like
[[420.24]]last time when we were behind the curve
[[426.8]]and so uh Tech really needs a voice and
[[433.44]]in particular little Tech needs a voice
[[439.24]]so big Tech has been president in
[[446.24]]Washington um but big Tech's interests
[[452.84]]are not only very different than kind of
[[459.56]]startup Innovation innovators interest
[[467.28]]but we think also kind of Divergent from
[[474.16]]America's interest as a whole and so
[[479.68]]that just makes it like quite imperative
[[483.68]]for us to be involved not only to
[[488.12]]represent the startup Community uh but
[[492.72]]also to kind of get to the right answer
[[495.52]]for the
[[500.56]]country um and you know for the country
[[507.24]]this is we think a mission critical
[[511.92]]effort because if you look at the last
[[516.84]]century of the world and you say okay
[[521.72]]why was America strong and why was
[[526.44]]basically any country
[[531.52]]significant in terms of military power
[[537.2]]economic power cultural power in the
[[542.6]]last hundred years and it was really
[[546.84]]those countries that got to the
[[552.08]]industrial revolution first and
[[558.36]]exploited it best and now at the dawn of
[[564.64]]the kind of Information Age Revolution
[[571.48]]um we need to be there and not fall
[[577.72]]behind not lose kind of our Innovative
[[584.24]]Edge and that's all really up for grabs
[[591.92]]um and really the kind of biggest way
[[597.32]]America would lose it because we're
[[602.16]]still like you know from a you know
[[607.24]]capitalistic system standpoint from an
[[611.04]]education standpoint and so forth from a
[[615.56]]talent standpoint we're extremely strong
[[620.44]]and should be a great innovator but the
[[624.64]]thing that would stop that would be kind
[[629.2]]of bad or misguided regulation that
[[634.36]]forces Innovation elsewhere out of the
[[639.92]]country and kind of prevents us
[[645.44]]ourselves America and the American
[[649.12]]government from adopting these
[[653.8]]Technologies as well um and kind of
[[660.28]]driving that you know driving the things
[[665.96]]that would uh kind of make
[[671.52]]us you know bad on Tech regulation our
[[676.72]]first really you know big Tech whose
[[682.64]]goal is not to drive Innovation or make
[[687.92]]America strong but to preserve their
[[692.92]]Monopoly you know we've seen that uh act
[[699.2]]out now and AI in a really spectacular
[[704.44]]way where big Tech has pushed for the
[[707.84]]Banning
[[712.0]]of open source for safety reasons safety
[[718.4]]reasons now you can't find anybody who's
[[723.72]]been in the computer industry who can
[[727.68]]tell you that any open- source project
[[732.2]]is less safe U from a first of all from
[[735.88]]a hacking
[[739.24]]standpoint uh you know and you talk
[[743.68]]about things like prompt injection and
[[747.76]]and then new attacks and so forth you
[[751.6]]would much more trust an open source
[[756.08]]solution for that kind of thing but also
[[760.32]]for you know a lot of the concerns of
[[764.36]]the US government about like you know
[[768.36]]copyright where does this technology
[[771.8]]come from and so forth not only should
[[776.0]]the source code be open but the data
[[780.48]]should probably also be open as well so
[[784.48]]we know what these things were trained
[[788.76]]on and you know and that's also for
[[792.8]]figuring out what their biases and so
[[796.24]]forth how can you know if it's a black
[[800.48]]box so this idea that you know close
[[805.32]]Source would be safer and big Tech
[[810.32]]actually got this you know some of this
[[815.24]]language into the Biden Administration
[[821.16]]executive order like literally on you
[[827.0]]know like under the guise of safety to
[[831.24]]protect themselves you know against
[[835.8]]competition is really really scary and
[[840.56]]so that's kind of a big driver the other
[[845.68]]kind of related driver is I think um
[[852.68]]this combination of big Tech pushing for
[[859.4]]fake safetyism to preserve their
[[865.04]]Monopoly and then rather thin
[[870.16]]understanding of how the Technologies
[[874.76]]work in the federal government and so
[[878.92]]without somebody kind of Bridging the
[[883.2]]education Gap uh they're very very you
[[888.48]]know we are as a country very vulnerable
[[894.8]]to these bad ideas um
[[901.44]]and we also think it's a just a critical
[[907.32]]point in Technology's history to get it
[[912.16]]right because if you think about what's
[[916.32]]possible with AI so many of our
[[920.96]]countries kind of biggest challenges are
[[926.56]]very solvable now you know things like
[[933.12]]education uh better and more equal
[[939.68]]Health Care um you know
[[946.56]]just thinning out the bureaucracy that
[[951.76]]we've built and making the government
[[955.68]]easier to deal with particularly you
[[960.84]]know for kind of underprivileged people
[[965.24]]trying to get into business and do
[[969.08]]things and become entrepreneurs all
[[972.96]]these things are made much much better
[[978.36]]by AI similarly you know crypto is
[[985.8]]really our best answer for you know kind
[[992.44]]of getting back to delivering the
[[997.28]]internet back to the people and away
[[1002.12]]from the large Tech monopolies it is the
[[1007.52]]one technology that can really do that
[[1011.56]]and you know if we don't do that you
[[1014.6]]know over the next five years these
[[1017.8]]monopolies are going to get much much
[[1021.32]]stronger probably some of them will be
[[1025.52]]stronger than the US government itself
[[1030.24]]uh and we have this technology that can
[[1034.64]]help us you know get to this you know
[[1039.36]]dream of stakeholder capitalism and and
[[1045.08]]participation for all economically um
[[1049.92]]and we could undermine the whole thing
[[1054.28]]with poor regulation and then finally
[[1059.92]]you know in the area of biology which is
[[1066.4]]we're at an amazing point in that if you
[[1073.44]]look at the kind of history of of uh
[[1079.12]]biology you know we've never had a
[[1083.04]]language just much like we never had a
[[1087.0]]language to describe physics for for a
[[1091.32]]thousand years we didn't have a language
[[1095.96]]to really model biology till now the
[[1100.68]]language for physics was calculus the
[[1105.56]]language for biology is AI and so we
[[1110.24]]have the opportunity to cure a whole
[[1114.28]]host of things we could never you know
[[1119.0]]touched before as well as kind of
[[1124.04]]address populations that we never even
[[1130.04]]like any testing on before and and and
[[1136.56]]always put in danger and you know this
[[1142.32]]again you have big
[[1147.6]]Pharma uh whose interest is in
[[1151.72]]preserving the existing system because
[[1155.56]]it kind of locks out all the kind of
[[1159.96]]innovative competition and so for all
[[1164.6]]those reasons we've like massively
[[1169.92]]committed the flag and the firm to being
[[1174.48]]involved in politics so you've been
[[1177.64]]spending a tremendous amount of time in
[[1180.96]]Washington I've been spending time in
[[1184.68]]Washington um you know many of our other
[[1188.96]]part parners like Chris Dixon and BJ
[[1192.72]]pondi have been spending time in
[[1198.68]]Washington we have like real actual kind
[[1205.52]]of a lobbying capability within the firm
[[1209.92]]and we'll talk about that some more but
[[1213.68]]call it government Affairs but you know
[[1217.12]]they're registered lobbyists and they're
[[1221.48]]working um to to kind of work with the
[[1225.56]]government and and set up the right
[[1229.16]]meetings and help us get our message
[[1233.52]]across and then we're deploying a you
[[1237.64]]know a really significant amount of
[[1244.0]]money um to basically pushing Innovation
[[1250.88]]forward making you know getting to the
[[1255.88]]right regulation on Tech um that
[[1261.28]]preserves America's strength and we are
[[1265.92]]not only committed to doing that this
[[1270.92]]year but for the next decade and so this
[[1276.0]]is a big effort for us and we thought
[[1280.2]]it'd be a good idea to uh talk about it
[[1283.44]]on the
[[1286.64]]podcast yeah thank you that was great
[[1290.52]]and then yeah the key point there at the
[[1293.8]]end is worth double underlining I think
[[1297.16]]which is long-term commitment um you
[[1300.76]]know there there there have been times
[[1305.36]]um with with tech specific Al where
[[1309.04]]there have been people who have kind of
[[1311.2]]cannonballed their way onto the
[[1313.88]]political scene you know with you know
[[1316.6]]large you know kind of bomb you know
[[1320.8]]sort of money bombs um and then you know
[[1324.96]]and maybe they were just single issue or
[[1327.92]]whatever but they're in and out or you
[[1330.88]]know they're just in and out they just
[[1333.44]]you know it was just like they thought
[[1336.28]]they could have short-term impact they
[[1338.88]]they you know then two years later
[[1342.04]]they're gone um we're we're thinking
[[1346.2]]about that very differently yeah and you
[[1349.52]]know and that's why I brought up you
[[1353.52]]know the historical lens we really think
[[1358.16]]that you know if America is going to be
[[1362.28]]America in the next hundred years we
[[1366.44]]have to get this right
[[1370.92]]y good okay we're going to unpack a lot
[[1374.64]]of what you talked about and go into
[[1377.72]]more detail about it so I will get going
[[1381.08]]on the questions which again thank you
[[1384.32]]everybody for submitting questions um on
[[1389.12]]X um we have a great lineup uh today so
[[1393.04]]I'm going to combine a bunch of these
[[1395.24]]questions because there there were some
[[1398.88]]themes so jar uh Jared asks why has Tech
[[1402.92]]been so reluctant to engage in the
[[1406.36]]political process both at the local and
[[1410.64]]National level until now and then Kate
[[1415.32]]asks interestingly the opposite question
[[1419.36]]um which I I I find this Chuck's
[[1422.36]]position very interesting because this
[[1424.88]]gets to the nature of kind of how how
[[1427.52]]we've got how we've gotten to where
[[1430.8]]we've gotten to Kate asked Tech leaders
[[1434.32]]have spent hundreds of millions lobbying
[[1438.8]]in DC right the opposite Point um in
[[1443.2]]your opinion has it worked and what
[[1445.76]]should we be doing differently as an
[[1448.24]]industry when it comes to working with
[[1452.04]]EC and so I wanted to kind of juxtapose
[[1455.64]]these two questions because I actually
[[1458.32]]think they're they're they're both true
[[1461.6]]and the the way that they're both true
[[1466.16]]is that there is no single Tech yeah um
[[1470.8]]right B to your point there there is no
[[1474.52]]single Tech and so and maybe once upon a
[[1478.32]]time there was you know and I I I would
[[1481.56]]say you know my my involvement in
[[1484.96]]political you know kind of uh efforts
[[1488.6]]and and you know in this domain started
[[1492.64]]you know 30 years ago um so I've seen a
[[1496.48]]lot of the evolution over the last three
[[1499.2]]decades and I was you know I was in the
[[1501.92]]room for the founding of TechNet which
[[1504.92]]is one of the sort of Legacy you know
[[1507.92]]kind
[[1512.88]]of John John Chambers and John door so
[[1517.56]]um you know so I've kind of seen a lot
[[1519.92]]of twists and turns on this over the
[[1523.16]]last 30 years and I I think you know the
[[1527.76]]way I would describe it um is you know
[[1532.08]]this you know as been said you know so
[[1535.52]]one is look there there there just you
[[1539.56]]know was there a diversion was there was
[[1543.84]]there a sort of a distinction and a real
[[1547.16]]difference of view between big Tech and
[[1550.16]]little tech 20 30 years ago yes there
[[1554.56]]was um it's much wider now um I would
[[1558.64]]say that that that whole thing has
[[1562.36]]really gapped out um you know the the
[[1566.88]]big Tech even big you probably remember
[[1570.8]]big tech companies in the 80s and 90s
[[1574.0]]often actually didn't really do much in
[[1577.52]]politics yeah um you know they didn't
[[1581.8]]really have you know probably like most
[[1586.48]]famously Microsoft probably you know
[[1590.8]]Microsoft probably would everybody at
[[1593.6]]Microsoft during that period would
[[1596.12]]probably say they had underinvested um
[[1598.72]]you know kind of given what happened
[[1601.76]]with the antitrust case that unfolded
[[1605.28]]yeah actually the one issue we were
[[1608.48]]United on was the stock option
[[1611.76]]accounting which
[[1615.64]]um you know interestingly and we were
[[1619.76]]against Warren Buffett and you know
[[1623.88]]Warren Buffet was absolutely wrong on it
[[1629.52]]and won um and it's actually very much
[[1635.2]]strengthened Tech monopolies so it I
[[1640.32]]think did the opposite of what you know
[[1646.0]]people in certainly in Silicon Valley
[[1651.44]]wanted and I think people you know in
[[1655.88]]washingtoniana and America what have
[[1659.84]]wanted was to you know make these
[[1663.84]]monopolies so strong and using their
[[1668.44]]Market cap to further strengthen their
[[1673.8]]Monopoly uh because we move from stock
[[1679.12]]options to you know it's too esoteric to
[[1684.6]]get into here but let's just say trust
[[1690.16]]me it was bad yes yes it was very good
[[1694.48]]for big companies very bad for startups
[[1698.36]]so um yeah and actually that's another
[[1701.76]]thing that actually happened in the 90s
[[1705.28]]and 2000s is um
[[1709.92]]so there's a fundamental characteristic
[[1713.52]]of the tech industry and in particular
[[1717.16]]Tech startups and Tech Founders um which
[[1720.32]]which and Ben and I would include
[[1722.52]]ourselves in that group which is we are
[[1727.52]]idiosyncratic disagreeable eastic people
[[1733.6]]um and so it like there is no Tech
[[1738.0]]startup Association like every every
[[1741.4]]Industry Group in the world in the
[[1744.84]]country has like an association that has
[[1748.56]]like offices at DC and lobbyists and
[[1751.8]]like major Financial Firepower and you
[[1754.56]]you know these undern names like you
[[1758.16]]know the MPAA in the music industry or
[[1762.64]]the movie industry and the Raa and the
[[1766.2]]in the record industry and the National
[[1769.24]]Association of broadcasters and you know
[[1772.28]]the national Oil and Gas Association and
[[1776.08]]so forth so like every other industry
[[1779.96]]has these these these groups that
[[1782.48]]basically where where basically the
[[1784.72]]industry participants come together and
[[1787.96]]agree a policy agenda they hire
[[1791.16]]lobbyists and they put a lot of money
[[1795.6]]behind it um the the tech uh industry
[[1800.44]]just we've just never been good at
[[1803.8]]actually especially the startups we've
[[1806.84]]never been good at agreeing on a common
[[1810.2]]platform um and in fact you know Ben you
[[1813.16]]just mentioned the stock option
[[1815.08]]accounting thing like that that's
[[1817.4]]actually that's my view of what happened
[[1820.88]]at TechNet uh which is TechNet was an
[[1824.6]]attempt to actually get like the startup
[[1827.4]]Founders and the new you know kind of
[[1830.12]]the new Dynamic tech companies together
[[1833.28]]but the problem was we all couldn't
[[1837.0]]agree on anything other than b basically
[[1840.28]]there were two issues we could agree on
[[1843.48]]stock option expensing as an issue and
[[1846.76]]we could agree on carried interest for
[[1850.8]]Venture Capital firms is an issue yeah
[[1855.04]]carried interest tax treatment and and
[[1858.08]]so there were the basically what ended
[[1861.96]]up happening was again my my view you
[[1865.96]]know kind of TechNet early on got
[[1869.16]]anchored on these I would say pretty
[[1873.44]]esoteric uh accounting uh and financial
[[1879.36]]issues um and just never had a view um
[[1884.16]]on you know could could not come to
[[1887.56]]agreement on on many other issues and I
[[1891.32]]think a lot of attempts to coordinate
[[1894.52]]Tech policy in the value had that
[[1897.8]]characteristic and then look quite
[[1901.68]]honestly you know the other side of it
[[1904.64]]Ben you highlighted this but I want to
[[1907.28]]really underline it it's just like look
[[1910.64]]the world has changed and you know up
[[1914.6]]until 2010 you know I would say up
[[1918.4]]around until about 2010 I think you
[[1921.64]]could argue that you know politics and
[[1924.84]]Tech were just never that relevant to
[[1928.4]]each other um you know for for the most
[[1931.76]]part what tech companies did was they
[[1935.44]]made tools um you know those tools got
[[1939.0]]sold to customers they use them in
[[1941.76]]different ways and so you know reg you
[[1944.28]]know how do you regulate it you know
[[1946.96]]database software or an operating system
[[1951.12]]or a word processor or a router
[[1955.64]]regulating a power drill or a hammer
[[1959.68]]right yeah exactly right exactly like
[[1962.84]]yeah what you know what are appropriate
[[1966.48]]shovel regulations um and so it just
[[1970.72]]wasn't that important and then you know
[[1973.72]]look this is where I think Silicon
[[1976.28]]Valley deserves you know kind of
[[1979.28]]deserves its share of blame for anything
[[1982.24]]whatever's gone wrong which is as a
[[1985.0]]consequence I think we all just never
[[1988.44]]actually thought it was that important
[[1991.48]]uh you know to really explain what we
[[1994.48]]were doing and it be really engaged in
[[1998.52]]the process out there um and then you
[[2001.76]]know look the other thing that happened
[[2004.08]]was you know there was a love affair for
[[2007.0]]a long time you know there was a view
[[2010.04]]that you know tech there was just a view
[[2012.64]]that like Tech startups are purely good
[[2015.88]]for society Tech is purely good for
[[2019.68]]society there were really no political
[[2024.28]]implications to Tech um the way this
[[2028.36]]actually continued interesting up
[[2032.12]]through 2012 um you know people now know
[[2035.92]]of all the headlines that you know
[[2039.2]]social media is destroying democracy and
[[2042.52]]you know all these things that kind of
[[2045.16]]really you know kicked into gear after
[[2050.68]]2015 2016 um but you know even 2012 like
[[2056.32]]the narrative you know social media had
[[2058.96]]become very important actually in the
[[2061.8]]2012 election but the narrative in the
[[2065.0]]in the Press was like almost uniformally
[[2068.28]]positive you know it was very
[[2071.2]]specifically that social media is
[[2074.88]]protecting democracy by making sure that
[[2078.76]]certain candidates get elected and then
[[2084.04]]also by way Obama um you know there were
[[2090.2]]literally headlines from you know very
[[2093.92]]uh you know newspapers and magazines
[[2096.6]]today that are very anti-tech that were
[[2099.68]]very prot Tech at that point because the
[[2103.32]]view is Tech helped Obama get reelected
[[2106.76]]and then the other thing um was actually
[[2110.32]]the Arab Spring you know there was this
[[2113.44]]moment where it was like Tech is not
[[2115.92]]only going to protect democracy in the
[[2118.56]]US but it's going to protect democracy
[[2121.96]]all over the world and you know Facebook
[[2125.44]]Google were the Catalyst were at the
[[2128.04]]time reviewed as the Catalyst for the
[[2130.36]]Arab Spring which is going to of course
[[2133.4]]bring a flowering of De democracy the
[[2137.32]]Middle East that has it didn't work out
[[2141.08]]that way by the way did not work out
[[2146.08]]that way um and so so anyway the point
[[2151.52]]is like it is relatively recent in the
[[2157.0]]last 10 12 years that it's just sort of
[[2162.6]]just like everything has just kind of
[[2166.24]]come together and all of a sudden you
[[2169.0]]know people in the in the in the in the
[[2172.32]]policy Arena are very focused on tech
[[2175.52]]people in the tech world have very
[[2178.72]]strong policy politics opinions the
[[2183.28]]media you know weighs in all the time um
[[2187.68]]and and then by the way other this you
[[2190.56]]know none of this is a us only
[[2192.72]]phenomenon we'll talk about other
[[2195.48]]countries later on but um there's also a
[[2199.04]]global you know kind of thing you know
[[2202.2]]these issues are playing out globally in
[[2205.88]]many different ways uh I I guess I one
[[2209.92]]thing I would add is like when I'm in
[[2213.16]]you know I do a fair amount in DC on the
[[2216.76]]on the on the non-political side and
[[2220.32]]when I'm in you know meetings uh
[[2223.56]]involving National Security or
[[2227.92]]intelligence or uh you know civil policy
[[2233.24]]of whatever kind it's it's striking um
[[2237.64]]how many topics that you would not think
[[2241.2]]are Tech topics and end up being Tech
[[2245.88]]topics yeah um and so you know and it's
[[2250.0]]just because like when the state
[[2253.24]]exercises power now it does so through
[[2256.56]]you know with technologically enabled
[[2260.24]]means um and then and then when citizens
[[2263.88]]you know basically resist the state or
[[2266.56]]fight back against the state they do so
[[2269.32]]with technologically enabled means and
[[2272.0]]so they they're sort of you know there's
[[2275.56]]sort of this you know sometimes say
[[2279.28]]we're the dog that caught the bus on on
[[2282.2]]this stuff right which is you know we we
[[2284.96]]we all want a tech to be important in
[[2288.28]]the world it turns out Tech is important
[[2291.52]]important in the world and then it turns
[[2293.84]]out the things that are important in the
[[2296.64]]world end up being end up getting pulled
[[2300.52]]into politics yeah yeah I think that's
[[2304.52]]right you know on the second part of the
[[2308.12]]question I think that's a you know like
[[2312.12]]why is techan so ineffective despite
[[2315.76]]pouring all the money in and I think
[[2320.8]]there are like a few kind of important
[[2326.2]]issues around that one is you know
[[2331.64]]really arrogance in that um I think you
[[2337.44]]know we and Tech and a lot of the people
[[2341.32]]went in are like oh we're the good guys
[[2344.92]]we're for the good and everybody will
[[2348.28]]love us when we get there and we can
[[2353.92]]just push our agenda on you know kind of
[[2361.64]]on the policy makers without really
[[2367.92]]putting in the time and the work to to
[[2373.04]]understand um the issues and the things
[[2378.72]]that you know you face as somebody in
[[2384.52]]Congress or somebody in the White House
[[2389.6]]um in trying to figure out what the
[[2394.6]]right policy is and I think that you
[[2400.12]]know we uh are coming at that from kind
[[2405.16]]of our cultural value which is we take a
[[2409.44]]long view of relationships we try never
[[2414.08]]to be transactional and I think that's
[[2418.84]]especially important on policy because
[[2423.88]]these things are massively complex and
[[2429.2]]so we understand our issues and our
[[2434.92]]needs and um but we have to take the
[[2441.0]]time to understand you know the issues
[[2446.12]]of the policy ERS and make sure that you
[[2450.24]]know we work with them to come up with a
[[2455.68]]solution that is viable for everyone and
[[2460.44]]so I think that's thing one I think
[[2463.52]]Texas has been very bad on that and the
[[2467.72]]second one is I think that uh you know
[[2471.32]]they've
[[2477.4]]been partisan where like it's been like
[[2484.72]]not necessary or not even smart to be
[[2489.64]]partisan so people have come in with
[[2496.24]]whatever like political B mostly kind of
[[2503.44]]democrat uh Democratic Party uh that
[[2509.08]]they have and like okay we're going to
[[2513.92]]go in um without understanding you and
[[2518.04]]only work with Democrats because we're
[[2521.92]]Democrats and this kind of thing and I
[[2526.6]]think you know our approach is look we
[[2532.0]]are here to represent Tech um we want to
[[2536.88]]work with policy makers on both sides of
[[2541.28]]the aisle we want to do what's best for
[[2546.52]]America we think that uh if we can
[[2551.76]]describe that correctly then then we'll
[[2556.12]]get support from both sides and and
[[2559.68]]that's just a really different approach
[[2563.16]]so hopefully hopefully that's right and
[[2566.6]]Hope we can make
[[2570.88]]progress okay good so let's go to the um
[[2576.12]]next question so um this is again a
[[2581.04]]two-part question so Sheen asks um in
[[2584.76]]what ways do you see the relationship
[[2588.0]]between Silicon Valley and DC evolving
[[2592.28]]in coming years um particularly in light
[[2596.12]]of recent regulatory efforts targeting
[[2599.36]]Tech Giants and we'll we'll talk about
[[2602.96]]we'll talk about Tik Tok later on but um
[[2606.16]]you know there's been obviously big uh
[[2608.72]]you know there's big flasho kind of
[[2611.84]]events happening right now by the way
[[2614.92]]also for people haven't seen you know
[[2617.96]]the doj just filed a massive antitrust
[[2622.36]]lawsuit against Apple yeah um you know
[[2627.48]]that the the the the the uh the uh the
[[2631.84]]you know the the tech topics are very
[[2635.36]]hot right now in DC so how do we see the
[[2638.96]]Rel by the way that's an inter that
[[2642.56]]one's an interesting one of the one of
[[2646.12]]the things that I've talked about um
[[2651.36]]which is you you know a lot of little
[[2656.96]]Tech I think is is very much in
[[2662.12]]alignment with some of the things that
[[2666.56]]um the
[[2672.56]]FTC is doing but probably we would do it
[[2680.04]]in a very different against a different
[[2686.36]]kind of set of uh practices and
[[2692.28]]behaviors of some of the tech monopolies
[[2697.92]]and and you know it it just shows why
[[2703.84]]like more conversation is important on
[[2708.04]]these things because you know what we
[[2711.96]]think is the kind of abuse of the
[[2717.04]]Monopoly and you know what the lawsuit
[[2721.96]]is I would say are not exactly the same
[[2725.8]]thing well let's talk about that let's
[[2728.2]]talk about that for a moment because
[[2730.68]]this is a good case study of of kind of
[[2735.52]]the Dynamics here so the traditional
[[2741.24]]kind of free market libertarian view you
[[2745.72]]know is is sort of very you know uh very
[[2749.36]]critical of antitrust you know theory in
[[2752.4]]general and it's certainly very critical
[[2755.0]]of the you know current prevailing
[[2758.64]]antitrust theories um you know which are
[[2762.36]]kind of more expansive and aggressive
[[2766.0]]than the ones of of the last 50 years um
[[2769.68]]you know as shown in things like the
[[2772.72]]Apple the Apple lawsuit and and many
[[2776.64]]other actions recently um and so you
[[2779.96]]know there there's sort of a you know
[[2782.44]]for people in business there's sort of a
[[2785.44]]reflexive view that you know basically
[[2788.6]]says businesses should be allowed to
[[2792.44]]operate um but then very specifically
[[2796.48]]there's this view or you know there are
[[2799.48]]certainly people who have this view that
[[2802.64]]basically says you know any additional
[[2806.4]]involvement of the political machine
[[2809.84]]especially the sort of prosecutorial
[[2813.6]]machine in Tech you know is invariably
[[2817.04]]going to make everything worse in Tech
[[2819.84]]and so yeah you know they sue Apple
[[2822.52]]today and maybe you're happy because you
[[2824.92]]don't like apple today because you know
[[2827.8]]they abused your startup or whatever but
[[2831.08]]like if they win against Apple they're
[[2834.0]]just going to keep coming and coming and
[[2836.76]]coming and do more and do do more and
[[2841.16]]more of these the the opposing view the
[[2845.4]]the opposite view would be the view that
[[2849.28]]says no actually um the interest to your
[[2853.0]]point the interest of big Tech and
[[2855.84]]little Tech have actually really
[[2860.08]]diverged um and that actually um if
[[2864.4]]there is not actually strong vigorous
[[2867.56]]investigation and enforcement and then
[[2870.72]]ultimately things things like the Apple
[[2874.68]]lawsuit um you know actually these these
[[2878.16]]companies are going to get so powerful
[[2880.68]]that they may be able to you know really
[[2883.72]]seriously damage you know little Tech uh
[[2887.08]]you know for for for for a very long
[[2890.6]]time so maybe been talk a little bit
[[2893.8]]about how you know kind of we we think
[[2896.36]]through that kind of you know because we
[[2900.04]]we even debate this inside our firm um
[[2903.76]]but talk a little bit through about how
[[2906.52]]how to how to process through that and
[[2909.16]]then you know what you think and then
[[2911.56]]also kind of where where you think those
[[2915.88]]lines of argument are taking us yeah so
[[2920.88]]look I definitely think and by the way
[[2924.12]]right you know I mean I should f
[[2927.8]]disclosure uh when we were at Netscape
[[2932.96]]um we we were certainly on the side of
[[2937.8]]little Tech against big Tech and you
[[2942.84]]know Microsoft at that time had a 97%
[[2948.16]]you know market share on desktop and you
[[2952.12]]know it was very very difficult to
[[2956.0]]innovate on the desktop it was just you
[[2960.48]]know bad for Innovation to have them you
[[2964.6]]know in that level of position of power
[[2967.96]]and I think that's happened on the
[[2972.92]]smartphone now you know particularly uh
[[2979.4]]with apple I think the um kind of the
[[2985.24]]Epic case and the Spotify cases are
[[2991.76]]really great examples of that where you
[[2998.64]]know I am I am Fielding you know product
[[3005.44]]that's competitive with Spotify and um I
[[3011.88]]am charging Spotify a 30% tax on their
[[3018.16]]product like that seems unfair um just
[[3024.32]]from like a consumer like like just just
[[3030.36]]from the standpoint of the world and uh
[[3035.4]]you know it does seem like it's you know
[[3038.68]]using Monopoly power in a very
[[3041.52]]aggressive way I think it's certainly
[[3045.28]]against our interest and the interest of
[[3051.56]]new companies uh for the monopolies to
[[3057.92]]exploit their power to that degree you
[[3061.92]]know like look when the government gets
[[3065.24]]it involved it's not going to be like a
[[3070.2]]clean surgical like okay here's exactly
[[3076.36]]the change that need that's needed but I
[[3083.4]]also think you know with these Global um
[[3090.6]]businesses with tremendous lock in uh
[[3096.2]]you know you just have to you know at
[[3100.68]]least have the conversation and say okay
[[3104.64]]what is this going to do for consumers
[[3109.44]]if we let it run and uh and you know we
[[3113.92]]need to represent that point of view I
[[3117.56]]think from the from the kind of small
[[3123.64]]Tech perspective yeah and the big tech
[[3128.72]]companies are certainly not doing us
[[3131.8]]favors right now
[[3136.0]]so they're certainly not acting in ways
[[3139.84]]that are pro startups I think we could
[[3143.68]]say as a general no no no no the
[[3148.4]]opposite sure quite the opposite one one
[[3152.24]]one of my one of my ideas I kick around
[[3155.28]]a lot is it's it feels like it feels
[[3159.68]]like companies it feels like any company
[[3165.64]]is either too Scrappy too arrogant yeah
[[3171.48]]um but never in the middle yeah yeah
[[3178.0]]yeah like it's it's like people
[[3184.0]]right you're either the underdog or
[[3187.68]]you're the overdog and there's not not a
[[3192.88]]lot of yeah not a lot of reasonable dogs
[[3199.52]]exactly exactly so there's inherent
[[3204.04]]tension there it seems very hard for
[[3206.52]]these companies to reach a point of
[[3208.92]]dominance and not figure out some way to
[[3212.2]]abuse it um which is a very I also think
[[3215.6]]you kind of touch on an important point
[[3219.56]]which is you know we're you know in
[[3224.04]]representing little Tech we're not not a
[[3229.68]]pure libertarian anti-regulatory kind of
[[3236.88]]you know Force here we think we need
[[3242.56]]regulation in places we certainly need
[[3248.0]]it um in drug development we certainly
[[3254.24]]need regulation in uh crypto and
[[3258.92]]financial services the financial
[[3263.68]]services aspect of crypto um is very
[[3267.92]]very important it's very important to
[[3271.32]]the industry that you know to that would
[[3275.44]]be strong in America with a proper kind
[[3279.64]]of regulatory regime so we're not
[[3284.96]]anti-regulation we're kind of Pro uh the
[[3290.44]]kind of Regulation that will kind of
[[3296.44]]make both Innovation strong and you know
[[3302.28]]the Country Strong yeah and we should
[[3305.96]]also say look like when we're advocating
[[3309.04]]on behalf of little tech there obviously
[[3312.2]]there's self-interest um you know kind
[[3314.84]]of as a component of that because we're
[[3317.24]]a venture capital firm and we back
[[3320.28]]startups and and so there's obviously a
[[3323.56]]straight financial interest there you
[[3326.64]]know I will say we you know I think Ben
[[3329.4]]you'd agree with me like we also feel
[[3332.68]]like philosophically like this is a very
[[3336.84]]uh sort of pro-america position very Pro
[[3340.48]]consumer position and the reason for
[[3344.64]]that is very straightforward um which is
[[3348.36]]uh you know bet as you've said many
[[3351.2]]times in the past uh the the motto of
[[3355.88]]any Monopoly is um or what's what's the
[[3360.64]]what's the what's the motto we don't
[[3365.16]]care because we don't have to right
[[3369.96]]exactly and so probably experienced if
[[3374.68]]you've called customer service when one
[[3379.76]]of these monopolies has uh you know
[[3384.6]]kicked you off their platform yes
[[3390.64]]exactly yes exactly um and so uh yeah
[[3395.56]]it's just there is something in the
[[3398.08]]nature of monopolies where they just
[[3400.68]]they have a you know if if they no
[[3404.52]]longer have to compete um and if they're
[[3409.16]]no longer disciplined by the market um
[[3413.2]]they they they basically go bad and then
[[3416.44]]and then and then you know how do you
[[3418.92]]prevent that from happening the way you
[[3421.4]]prevent that is from forcing them to
[[3423.68]]compete the way that they have to
[[3426.16]]compete you know in some cases they
[[3429.44]]compete with each other although often
[[3432.64]]they collude with each other which is
[[3436.08]]another thing uh you know Monopoly and
[[3439.44]]cartel are kind of two sides of the same
[[3442.72]]coin but you know really it's at least
[[3445.76]]in the history of the tech industry it's
[[3448.16]]really when they're faced with startup
[[3451.36]]competition um you know when they've got
[[3454.24]]you know when they've got a when the
[[3456.56]]elephant has a terrier at his heels
[[3459.28]]nipping at him you know taking
[[3462.08]]increasingly big bites out of his foot
[[3465.16]]like that that's big companies actually
[[3468.64]]act and when they when they when when
[[3472.44]]when they do new things um and so
[[3476.12]]without healthy startup competition you
[[3480.44]]know like let's say there are many
[[3484.4]]sectors of the economy where it's just
[[3487.0]]very clear now that there's not enough
[[3489.48]]startup competition because the
[[3492.0]]incumbents that everybody deals with on
[[3495.08]]a daily basis are just practically
[[3499.44]]intolerable um and it's not in anybody's
[[3504.36]]interest ultimately um you know from
[[3508.76]]from a national uh policy standpoint um
[[3512.32]]you know for that to be the case you
[[3515.56]]know that you know things things can get
[[3518.68]]bad where it's to the benefit of the big
[[3521.4]]companies to preserve those monopolies
[[3524.0]]but very much not to anybody else's
[[3528.68]]benef yeah no exactly exactly you know
[[3534.6]]which is I would say such a big impetus
[[3539.72]]behind our kind of political activity
[[3543.76]]yeah that's right okay we'll keep going
[[3547.24]]um so um in what ways do you okay now
[[3550.76]]we're going to Future looking so in what
[[3553.6]]ways do you see the relationship between
[[3556.48]]Silicon Valley and DC evolving in the
[[3560.68]]coming years um and then um specifically
[[3564.64]]um and again what we're going to be not
[[3567.24]]we're not going to be making partisan
[[3570.72]]recommendations um here but you know
[[3575.8]]there is an election coming up um and it
[[3581.08]]is a big deal um and it's going to have
[[3585.0]]you know both both what happens in the
[[3587.84]]in the White House and what happens in
[[3590.76]]the Congress is going to have big
[[3593.48]]consequences for everything we've just
[[3596.64]]been discussing um so how do we see the
[[3601.44]]upcoming election affecting Tech policy
[[3607.16]]um and Ben why don't you start yeah well
[[3612.96]]I think there are you know several
[[3617.68]]issues that end up being really
[[3623.92]]important to kind of uh educate people
[[3631.28]]on now because whatever you whatever
[[3638.28]]platform you run on um you know as a
[[3644.72]]congress person or as the president you
[[3649.48]]want to kind of live up to that promise
[[3654.08]]when you get elected and so a lot of
[[3658.8]]these kind of positions that will
[[3662.76]]persists over the next four years are
[[3667.04]]going to be established now um I think
[[3672.64]]in you know crypto in particular uh you
[[3677.2]]know we've been very active on this
[[3681.2]]because there's
[[3686.48]]um you know we have a big uh kind of
[[3690.92]]donation to something called the fair
[[3694.56]]Shake pack which is kind of work on this
[[3699.84]]and just identifying for kind of
[[3705.76]]citizens like okay which politicians are
[[3711.84]]on what side of these issues uh you know
[[3719.08]]who are the kind of just Flatout anti-
[[3726.4]]crypto anti- innovation anti- blockchain
[[3733.12]]anti- decentralized technology um
[[3738.2]]candidates and like let's at least know
[[3741.76]]who they are so that we can tell them we
[[3747.16]]don't like it and then you know tell all
[[3752.92]]the kind of people who agree with us
[[3758.36]]that that we don't like it um and you
[[3764.8]]know a lot of it ends up being you know
[[3770.4]]look we want the right regulation for
[[3774.96]]crypto we've you know worked hard with
[[3779.24]]policy makers to you know kind of help
[[3784.08]]them formulate things that will you know
[[3787.88]]prevent
[[3792.08]]scams uh prevent nefarious uses of the
[[3796.76]]technology for things like money
[[3802.16]]laundering and so forth um and then
[[3809.2]]enable uh the good companies the
[[3815.84]]companies that are you know Pro consumer
[[3821.12]]helping you own your own data and not
[[3825.2]]have it own by some Monopoly Corporation
[[3829.96]]who can exploit it or just lose it you
[[3835.16]]know like get broken into and so you now
[[3839.56]]have identity theft problems and so
[[3844.52]]forth um that can kind of help uh kind
[[3850.48]]of a fairer economy for Creative so that
[[3856.4]]you know there's not a 99% Tech rate or
[[3861.44]]take rate on you know things that you
[[3864.8]]create on social media and these kinds
[[3870.92]]of things uh and so um you know like
[[3877.04]]it's just important to kind of I think
[[3881.76]]educate the populace on whereever
[[3886.84]]candidate stands on these issues and so
[[3890.88]]we're really really focused on that and
[[3894.84]]I think you know same true for AI same
[[3900.4]]true for Bio i' also add um and talk a
[[3905.04]]little bit more about the election in a
[[3907.92]]moment but I'd also add like it's not
[[3911.72]]actually the case that there's a single
[[3915.32]]party in DC that's protecting a single
[[3919.68]]party that's anti-tech um definitely
[[3924.64]]not there's not and and by the way if
[[3928.6]]that were the case it would make might
[[3933.32]]make life a lot easier yes um uh but but
[[3938.32]]but it's not the case um and I'll just
[[3941.28]]give then I'll just give a thumbnail
[[3943.56]]sketch of at least what I see when I'm
[[3947.24]]in DC and see if you agree with this um
[[3951.96]]so uh it would say the Democrats are
[[3955.68]]sort of Democrats are much more fluent
[[3959.96]]in Tech um and I think that has to do
[[3964.0]]with um you know who their kind of
[[3967.2]]Elites are um it has to do with this
[[3970.8]]kind of very long-established revolving
[[3974.52]]door and I I I mean that in both the
[[3979.0]]positive and perjorative sense um
[[3983.52]]between uh the tech companies and the
[[3987.08]]Democratic party uh Democratic
[[3990.32]]politicians political offices
[[3993.2]]Congressional offices White House
[[3996.04]]offices um there's just a lot more
[[3999.48]]integration uh you know the big tech
[[4002.92]]companies tend to be very democratic um
[[4005.64]]which you see in all the donation
[[4008.76]]numbers and voting numbers um and so
[[4011.96]]there's just like there are just a lot
[[4015.28]]more I would say Tech fluent Tech aware
[[4019.48]]um uh Democrats especially in in
[[4023.12]]powerful positions you know many of them
[[4026.68]]have actually worked in tech companies
[[4029.96]]just as an example the current white
[[4032.92]]house chief of staff uh is you know
[[4036.0]]former board member meta where I'm on
[[4039.48]]the board um and so there's just you
[[4043.28]]know there's there's a lot of sort of
[[4047.88]]connective tissue uh uh between those
[[4052.32]]you know look having said that you know
[[4055.56]]the the current Democratic party and in
[[4058.52]]particular you know certain of its more
[[4062.2]]radical wings um you know have become
[[4066.28]]extremely anti-tech um you know to the
[[4069.68]]point of being arguably you know in some
[[4073.28]]cases you know outright you know anti
[[4077.68]]anti- bus anti capitalism and so there
[[4081.24]]you know there there's there's a real
[[4084.48]]kind of back and forth there you know
[[4088.68]]Republicans um on the other hand like
[[4092.52]]you know in theory and The Stereotype
[[4095.2]]would have you believe you know
[[4097.64]]Republicans are sort of inherently you
[[4101.32]]know more Pro business and more Pro pro-
[[4104.92]]free markets and should therefore be
[[4108.76]]more more Pro Tech but I would say there
[[4113.12]]again it's a mixed bag because number
[[4116.96]]one a lot of Republicans just basically
[[4120.28]]think of Silicon Valley that it's all
[[4124.48]]Democrats uh um and so silicon Val all
[[4128.6]]Democrats if we're Republicans that
[[4131.6]]means they're de facto the enemy they
[[4134.48]]they hate us they're trying to defeat us
[[4137.56]]they're trying to defeat our policies um
[[4140.84]]and so they must be the enemy and so
[[4143.64]]there's a lot of you know I would say
[[4147.76]]some combination of distrust and fear um
[[4153.16]]and hate um you know kind of on that
[[4157.52]]front you know and then again with with
[[4160.6]]much less connective tissue you know
[[4163.92]]there are many fewer you know Republican
[[4166.88]]uh you know Executives at these
[[4169.08]]companies which means there are many
[[4172.68]]fewer Republican officials or staffers
[[4176.72]]who have Tech experience and so there's
[[4180.12]]there's a lot of mistrust and of course
[[4183.16]]you know there have been flat flash
[[4185.6]]point issues around this lately like
[[4188.28]]social media censorship that have really
[[4193.48]]exacerbated this this conflict um and
[[4200.52]]then uh the other thing is um uh you
[[4205.68]]know they're very serious polic policy
[[4209.16]]disagreements and there again there are
[[4212.36]]at least wings of the modern Republican
[[4215.76]]party that are actually quite uh you
[[4220.48]]know say uh sort of economically
[[4226.0]]interventionist um and so you know you
[[4230.0]]know the term of the moment is
[[4233.84]]industrial policy yeah right which
[[4237.72]]basically you know there there are
[[4240.6]]Republicans who are very much in favor
[[4243.72]]of a much more interven
[[4247.28]]government approach towards dealing with
[[4250.52]]business and particular dealing with
[[4254.36]]tech um and so I guess say like there
[[4259.64]]there's real There's real like this is
[[4264.0]]not a this is not an either or thing
[[4266.84]]like there there are real issues on both
[[4269.92]]sides the way we think about that is
[[4273.12]]therefore there's a real requirement to
[[4275.64]]engage on both sides there's a real
[[4278.24]]requirement Ben to your point to to
[[4282.04]]educate on both sides um and there's a
[[4285.72]]real uh you know you know if you're
[[4288.16]]going to make any progress at Tech
[[4290.48]]issues there's a real need to have a bip
[[4292.92]]partis and approach here because you do
[[4296.16]]have to actually work with both sides
[[4300.28]]yeah I I think that's absolutely right
[[4305.4]]and just to kind kind of um name names a
[[4310.6]]little uh if you look at like the
[[4315.0]]Democratic side you know you've got um
[[4319.32]]people like Richie Torres out of the
[[4324.32]]Bronx um and you know like by the way
[[4329.48]]huge swath of the Congressional Black
[[4334.64]]Caucus that sees wow crypto is a real
[[4340.56]]opportunity um to equal the financial
[[4345.12]]system which has you know historically
[[4350.72]]been you know you know documented racist
[[4356.6]]against uh kind of a lot of their
[[4360.48]]constituents and then also you know the
[[4364.84]]creatives which they represent a lot to
[[4369.36]]kind of get a fair Shake um and then on
[[4373.28]]the other hand you have Elizabeth Warren
[[4378.04]]who has taken a very totalitarian view
[[4383.76]]of the financial system and is moving to
[[4388.68]]consolidate everything in the hands of
[[4393.84]]you know a very small number of banks um
[[4399.32]]and basically control who can
[[4404.64]]participate and who cannot uh in in
[[4409.88]]finance uh so you know these are just
[[4413.92]]very very different views out of the
[[4418.52]]same party and I think that you know we
[[4424.72]]need to just make the specific issues
[[4430.28]]really really clear yeah and the same
[[4435.08]]thing we could you know spend a long
[[4438.8]]time also naming names on the Republican
[[4444.44]]side so yes um yes which we do later but
[[4451.68]]um so um yeah well I actually should do
[[4455.48]]it right now just to make sure that
[[4457.88]]we're Fair on this um you know there
[[4460.8]]there are there are Republican you know
[[4463.16]]look there are Republicans who are like
[[4466.28]]full-on Pro free market you know um you
[[4470.12]]know very much Pro you know are very
[[4473.12]]opposed to all current government
[[4476.32]]efforts to you know intervene in markets
[[4480.2]]like a and crypto by the way many of
[[4484.24]]those same Republicans are also very Pro
[[4488.2]]are also very negative any any antitrust
[[4491.2]]action they're very ideologically
[[4493.92]]opposed to antitrust and so they would
[[4497.16]]also be opposed to things like the Apple
[[4500.6]]lawsuit uh that a lot of startup
[[4504.8]]Founders might actually like um and then
[[4508.48]]on the other on the flip side you have
[[4511.6]]folks uh like Josh Josh Holly for
[[4514.8]]example that are I would say quite
[[4519.2]]vocally um U say I rate at Silicon
[[4524.36]]Valley and and I you know very in favor
[[4527.76]]of much more government intervention and
[[4531.2]]control you know I think a Hol
[[4534.72]]Administration just as an example would
[[4538.8]]be extremely interventionist um in um in
[[4543.16]]in in Silicon Valley um and would be
[[4546.4]]very you know kind of very pro-
[[4549.8]]industrial policy very much trying to
[[4553.88]]but both you know sort of set goals and
[[4557.4]]and sort of have government management
[[4560.92]]of more of tech but also uh much more
[[4564.56]]dramatic action against you know at
[[4567.92]]least perceived a real real enemy so
[[4572.48]]it's the same same same kind of mix spe
[[4576.84]]um yeah so so anyway that I wanted to go
[[4579.68]]through that though this is kind of
[[4582.56]]that's kind of the long whining answer
[[4585.64]]to the question of how will the upcoming
[[4589.84]]election AFF Tech policy um which is uh
[[4594.08]]you know look there you know there there
[[4596.4]]are real issues with the Biden
[[4598.96]]Administration in particular with the
[[4602.28]]with the agencies and and with some of
[[4605.52]]the Affiliated Senators has been just
[[4608.72]]described so you know there there are
[[4613.32]]certainly issues where um you know that
[[4617.32]]you know the agencies you know under
[[4620.12]]under under the Trump Administration the
[[4622.88]]agencies would be headed by very
[[4626.04]]different kinds of people uh having said
[[4629.44]]that it's not that you know it's not
[[4631.8]]that a trump presidency would
[[4634.8]]necessarily be a clean win um you know
[[4638.52]]and there are many people in sort of
[[4642.6]]that Wing who might be hostile in by the
[[4646.92]]way in in in in in different ways or or
[[4650.0]]actually might be hostile in some cases
[[4653.48]]in in the in the same ways yeah and by
[[4658.28]]the way you know Trump is himself has
[[4662.6]]been quite the moving Target on it
[[4667.16]]um you know he was very he tried to ban
[[4672.0]]Tik Tok and now he's very Pro Tik Tock
[[4677.28]]um you know he has been you know
[[4682.48]]negative on AI who's originally negative
[[4687.6]]on crypto now positive on crypto so you
[[4693.76]]know it it's it's complex and you know
[[4698.68]]which is why I think the foundation of
[[4703.64]]all of this is you know education and we
[[4708.4]]you know why we're spending so much time
[[4711.92]]in Washington and so forth is to make
[[4716.16]]sure that you know we communicate all
[[4720.48]]that we know about technology so that at
[[4724.64]]least these decisions are highly
[[4729.68]]informed that the politicians make good
[[4734.92]]okay so moving forward so uh uh three
[[4739.08]]part three three questions in one so
[[4743.2]]Alex asks um as Tech regulation becomes
[[4746.96]]more and more popular within Congress
[[4750.56]]which is happening um do you anticipate
[[4754.28]]a lowering in general of the rate of
[[4758.68]]innovation within the industry um number
[[4764.04]]two Tyler asks what is a key policy
[[4767.88]]initiative that if pass in the next
[[4770.92]]decade could bolster the US for a
[[4775.0]]century um and then Elliot Parker asks
[[4779.0]]what's one regulation that if removed
[[4782.08]]would have the biggest positive impact
[[4786.56]]economic growth yeah so I think
[[4791.8]]that b if you disagree with this I I
[[4795.32]]don't know that there's a single
[[4798.92]]regulation um or a single law or a
[[4802.72]]single issue um you know there are
[[4805.24]]certainly I mean there are certainly
[[4807.68]]individual laws or regulations that are
[[4811.72]]important um but I I think the Thematic
[[4816.8]]thing is a much bigger problem or much
[[4820.96]]bigger the Thematic thing is the thing
[[4825.08]]that matters the things that are coming
[[4829.16]]are much more serious than the things
[[4832.72]]that have been I think that's correct
[[4836.16]]yeah oh okay we'll talk about that yeah
[[4838.36]]go
[[4842.56]]ahead yeah I mean so
[[4848.08]]you know if you look at the current
[[4852.36]]state of
[[4856.4]]Regulation you
[[4863.32]]know if it stayed here um there's not
[[4870.36]]anything that
[[4874.8]]like we really feel like a burning
[[4880.28]]desire to remove it in the same way that
[[4886.08]]things that are on the table could be
[[4890.76]]extremely destructive and basically you
[[4896.4]]know look if we ban large language Mo or
[[4903.16]]large models in general or we you know
[[4907.64]]force them to go through some kind of
[[4911.0]]you know reg government
[[4915.36]]approval um or if we ban open source
[[4920.16]]technology um you know that would have
[[4923.92]]just a devastating it would basically
[[4929.16]]take America out of the AI game um and
[[4934.56]]you know make us extremely vulnerable
[[4938.4]]from a military standpoint make us
[[4943.88]]extremely vulnerable uh from a you know
[[4948.92]]technology standpoint in
[[4952.56]]general and
[[4957.0]]so you know that you know that that's
[[4962.16]]devastating similarly you if we don't
[[4968.68]]get um kind of proper regulation around
[[4977.04]]crypto the trust in um the system and
[[4985.28]]the business model is gonna fade uh or
[[4991.08]]is going to kind of be in Jeopardy and
[[4994.56]]that it's not going to be the best place
[[4998.84]]in the world to build crypto companies
[[5003.28]]um and blockchain companies which would
[[5008.64]]be a real shame you know the uh kind of
[[5014.56]]analog would be the kind of creation of
[[5018.72]]the SEC you know after the Great
[[5024.04]]Depression which really helped put trust
[[5029.96]]into the US uh Capital markets and I
[[5035.0]]think that you know trust into the
[[5040.68]]blockchain system as a way to kind of
[[5047.16]]invest participate be a consumer be an
[[5052.12]]entrepreneur are really really important
[[5055.6]]and necessary and very important to get
[[5059.8]]those right okay and then speaking okay
[[5063.8]]let's move straight into the specific
[[5067.28]]issues then more so um expand on that so
[[5071.24]]Lenny asks what form do you think AI
[[5075.56]]regulation will take over the next two
[[5081.44]]administrations um B asks will AI
[[5086.84]]regulation result in a concentrated few
[[5090.88]]companies or an explosion of startups um
[[5095.28]]and new innovation um iray asks how
[[5098.76]]would you prevent the AI industry from
[[5101.52]]being monopolized centralized by just a
[[5105.28]]few Tech Corps and then our our friend
[[5110.04]]bef jizos uh asks uh how do you see the
[[5114.2]]regulation of AI compute and open source
[[5118.24]]models realistically playing out uh
[[5121.92]]where can we apply pressure to make sure
[[5124.68]]we maintain our freedom to build and own
[[5127.44]]AI systems it's really interesting
[[5132.32]]because there's like a regulatory um
[[5138.72]]dimension of that and then there's the
[[5143.84]]uh kind of
[[5148.0]]technological kind
[[5153.84]]of you know version of that and they do
[[5159.8]]intersect so if you look at what big
[[5163.84]]Tech has been trying to do they're
[[5168.88]]trying they're very worried about new
[[5173.92]]competition to the point where they've
[[5177.28]]take it upon themselves to go to
[[5180.56]]Washington and try and Outlaw their
[[5186.64]]competitors um and you know if they
[[5192.72]]succeed with that then I think it is
[[5197.16]]like super concentrated AI power you
[[5203.0]]know making the kind of concentrated
[[5208.64]]power of social media or search or so
[[5212.76]]forth like kind of really pale in
[[5217.04]]comparison I mean it would be very
[[5221.12]]dramatic if there were only three
[[5225.56]]companies that were allowed to build AI
[[5230.28]]um and and that's certainly what they're
[[5234.88]]pushing for so I think in one regulatory
[[5240.16]]world where big Tech wins um then
[[5246.16]]there's very few companies doing AI
[[5252.2]]probably you know Google Microsoft and
[[5257.08]]meta um um you
[[5261.64]]know Microsoft
[[5266.0]]you know having you know basically full
[[5270.6]]control of open AI as they kind of
[[5274.8]]demonstrated they they have the source
[[5278.52]]code they have the weight you know such
[[5282.28]]a when as far as saying that you we own
[[5286.2]]everything and then they also kind of
[[5290.16]]control who the CEO is as they
[[5295.08]]demonstrated you know beautifully um so
[[5300.76]]you know if you take that it will all be
[[5305.8]]owned by you know three maybe four
[[5311.16]]companies um if you just follow though
[[5316.48]]the technological Dimension um I think
[[5320.48]]what we're seeing play out has been
[[5325.8]]super exciting in that um you know we
[[5331.96]]were all kind of wondering would there
[[5338.12]]be one model that ruled them all um and
[[5343.8]]even within a company I think we're
[[5347.88]]finding that there's no current
[[5353.08]]architecture that's going to gain you
[[5357.88]]know on a single thing a Transformer
[[5361.88]]Model A diffusion model and so forth
[[5366.64]]that's going to become so smart in
[[5371.12]]itself that once you make it big enough
[[5374.24]]it's just going to know everything and
[[5377.56]]that's going to be that um what we've
[[5381.4]]seen is you know even the large
[[5385.12]]companies are deploying a technique
[[5389.64]]called the mixture of experts which kind
[[5393.64]]of implies you know you need different
[[5396.6]]architectures for different things they
[[5399.84]]need to be integrated in a certain way
[[5404.2]]and the system has to work and that just
[[5409.08]]opens the aperture for a lot of
[[5413.52]]competition because there's many many
[[5418.44]]ways to construct a mixture of experts
[[5423.68]]to architect every piece of that we've
[[5428.88]]seen you know little companies like MW
[[5433.96]]field models that are highly competitive
[[5438.64]]with you know the larger models um very
[[5442.56]]quickly
[[5447.4]]uh and you know and then there's um
[[5452.96]]other kind of factors like you know
[[5458.12]]latency cost Etc that factor into this
[[5462.88]]and then there's also good enough like
[[5467.68]]when is a language model good enough you
[[5472.08]]know when it speaks English when it
[[5476.0]]knows about what things um what are you
[[5480.48]]using it for and then there's domain
[[5485.28]]specific data you know I've been doing
[[5490.28]]whatever medical research for years and
[[5494.8]]I've got uh you know data around all
[[5499.2]]these kinds of genetic patterns and
[[5504.32]]diseases and so forth you know I can
[[5509.08]]build a model against that data that's
[[5513.32]]differentiated by the data and so on so
[[5518.72]]I think what we will we're likely to see
[[5523.8]]kind of a a
[[5529.16]]great um kind of caman explosion of
[[5535.08]]innovation across all sectors you know
[[5539.48]]big companies small companies and so
[[5543.48]]forth provided that the regulation
[[5548.4]]doesn't Outlaw the small companies um
[[5553.0]]but that would be uh my prediction right
[[5557.36]]now yeah and i' i' add a bunch of I add
[[5561.56]]a bunch of things to this so um so one
[[5565.68]]is um even on the big model side um
[[5569.12]]there's been this leap frogging thing
[[5573.56]]that's taking place um and so uh you
[[5578.2]]know there's there's you know opening
[[5581.2]]you know gp4 was kind of you know the
[[5584.44]]dominant model not that long ago and
[[5587.08]]then it's it's been leap frogged in
[[5590.12]]significant ways recently by both Google
[[5594.48]]with their Gemini Pro especially the one
[[5598.48]]with the so-called long context window
[[5602.48]]where you can feed it 700,000 words um
[[5607.04]]or an hour of full motion video as you
[[5611.44]]know context for a question which a huge
[[5615.96]]Advance um and then uh you know the
[[5620.8]]anthropic uh their big model claw
[[5625.28]]um is uh you know lot a lot of people
[[5628.36]]now are finding that to be more advanced
[[5631.32]]model than gp4 and and you know and one
[[5634.56]]assumes open a is going to come back and
[[5637.24]]you know this leap frogging will
[[5640.4]]probably happen for a while so so so
[[5645.44]]even at the highest end you know at the
[[5649.44]]moment these companies are still
[[5653.28]]competing with each other um uh you know
[[5657.4]]there there's still this Lea frogging
[[5659.72]]that's taking place and then you know
[[5663.04]]Ben as you as you articulated um you
[[5666.56]]know very well you know there there is
[[5670.04]]this this giant explosion of of models
[[5673.8]]of all kinds of shapes and sizes um our
[[5677.24]]another you know our company data bricks
[[5680.32]]uh just released another you know
[[5682.44]]another
[[5684.44]]what looks like a big leap frog on the
[[5688.6]]smaller model side um it's the I think
[[5692.72]]it's the best small model now in the
[[5696.04]]benchmarks and it is it actually it's so
[[5700.28]]efficient it will run in a Macbook yeah
[[5704.24]]and they have the advantage of you know
[[5708.32]]as a as an Enterprise you can connect it
[[5713.32]]to a system that gives you not only like
[[5718.08]]Enterprise quality access control and
[[5722.72]]all that kind of thing but also um you
[[5727.96]]know gives you the power to do SQL
[[5733.24]]queries with it gives you the power to
[[5738.6]]um basically create a catalog so that
[[5743.24]]you can have a common understood
[[5746.92]]definition of all the weird corporate
[[5751.12]]words you have like by the way one of
[[5755.52]]which is customer like there there's
[[5759.08]]almost no two companies that Define
[[5762.8]]customer in the same way and in most
[[5766.76]]companies there are several definitions
[[5771.12]]of of customer you know from is it a
[[5776.96]]department at AT&T is it AT&T is it you
[[5783.56]]know some you know division of AT&T etc
[[5790.08]]etc I I think um I don't want to
[[5795.0]]literally speak for them but I think if
[[5798.4]]you put the CEOs of the big companies
[[5803.0]]under serum I think what they would say
[[5808.12]]is their big fear is that AI is actually
[[5811.96]]not going to lead to a monopoly for them
[[5814.6]]it's going to lead to a commodity it's
[[5817.36]]going to lead to a sort of a race to the
[[5821.84]]bottom on price um and and you see that
[[5826.36]]a little bit now which is people who are
[[5829.84]]using one of the big models apis are
[[5833.32]]able to swap to another big model API
[[5836.76]]from another company pretty easily and
[[5840.52]]then you know these models the business
[[5843.88]]model the main business model for these
[[5847.4]]big models at least so far is API you
[[5851.6]]know basically pay per token uh
[[5856.96]]generated um or per answer um and so
[[5861.56]]like if these companies really have to
[[5864.6]]compete with each other like it it may
[[5867.56]]be that it actually is a hyper
[[5870.0]]competitive market it may be the
[[5873.48]]opposite of like a search Market uh or
[[5877.08]]like an operating system Market it may a
[[5879.4]]market where there's just like
[[5882.0]]continuous competition and Improvement
[[5885.0]]and leap frogging and then you know
[[5888.44]]constant price competition and then of
[[5891.96]]course you know the payoff from that is
[[5894.76]]you know to everybody else in the world
[[5897.76]]is like an enormously vibrant Market
[[5900.76]]where there's constant Innovation
[[5903.56]]happening and then there's constant cost
[[5907.04]]optimization happening where and then
[[5910.36]]and then as as a customer you know
[[5913.04]]Downstream of this the entire world
[[5915.52]]that's going to use AI is going to
[[5918.48]]benefit from this kind of hyper
[[5921.92]]competition that's gonna you know could
[[5925.16]]potentially run for run for decades and
[[5928.32]]so I I think if you put these CEOs in a
[[5931.08]]TR serum what they would say is that's
[[5935.28]]actually their nightmare like that
[[5940.04]]that's why they're in Washington that's
[[5943.56]]why they're in Washington so that that's
[[5946.84]]that that is what's actually happening
[[5949.6]]that is the scenario they're trying to
[[5952.32]]prevent um they are actually trying to
[[5956.28]]shut out competition uh and by the way
[[5959.92]]actually I will I will tell you this
[[5964.0]]there is a funny thing Tech is so ham
[[5968.92]]Tech is so historically bad at politics
[[5973.36]]um that I think I think some of these
[[5977.12]]folks think they're being very clever in
[[5980.44]]how they go about this um and so you
[[5983.56]]know because they show up in Washington
[[5985.96]]with the kind of Nar you know kind of
[[5989.12]]Public Service narrative or end of the
[[5992.16]]world narrative or whatever it is and
[[5994.48]]they're I think they think that they're
[[5996.96]]going to very cleverly kind of trick
[[5999.76]]everybody trick people in Washington
[[6003.48]]into giving them sort of cartel status
[[6006.68]]and the people in Washington won't
[[6008.76]]realize until it's too late but it
[[6011.6]]actually turns out people in Washington
[[6015.04]]are actually quite cynical they've been
[[6020.4]]lobbied before exactly and so uh there
[[6025.52]]there is this thing and then you know
[[6028.6]]they won't they don't I get this from
[[6031.84]]them off the Record a lot especially
[[6034.52]]after a couple of drinks which is
[[6036.8]]basically if you've been in Washington
[[6039.32]]for longer than 2 minutes you have seen
[[6042.48]]many Industries come to Washington many
[[6045.6]]big companies come to Washington and
[[6048.4]]want Monopoly or cartel kind of
[[6052.72]]regulatory protection um and so you you
[[6057.12]]SE you've seen this and if you're in
[[6060.0]]Washington you've seen this play out you
[[6062.64]]know in some cases the guys's been there
[[6065.6]]for a long time dozens or hundreds of
[[6070.4]]times um and so my my sense is like nine
[[6075.24]]months ago or something there was a
[[6078.64]]moment where it seemed like the big tech
[[6081.6]]companies could kind of get away with
[[6085.24]]this um I think it's it's it's actually
[[6089.16]]I think I think actually it's it's the
[[6092.36]]edges there I'm still concerned and
[[6095.12]]we're still working on it but I think
[[6097.36]]the edges come off a little bit because
[[6100.52]]I think the cynicism of Washington in
[[6103.72]]this case is actually correct and I
[[6105.84]]think they're kind of on to these
[[6108.36]]companies and then you know look if
[[6111.4]]there's unifying issue there's basically
[[6114.44]]two unifying issues in Washington one is
[[6117.12]]they don't like China and the others
[[6120.96]]they don't like big Tech um and so you
[[6126.8]]know this is I this is a winnable War
[[6132.32]]like this is a winnable war on behalf of
[[6136.52]]of startups and open source um and and
[[6140.12]]freedom and and competition and so I'm
[[6144.28]]actually yeah I'm I'm I'm worried but I
[[6147.6]]I'm feeling much better about it than I
[[6151.16]]was nine months ago yeah yeah well look
[[6155.12]]we had to show up I mean that's the
[[6159.24]]other thing I mean it's t me a real less
[[6164.8]]which is um you know you can't expect
[[6170.0]]people to know what's in your head you
[[6173.52]]know you've got to go see them you've
[[6176.4]]got to put in the time you've got to
[[6181.32]]kind of say what you think and then you
[[6186.0]]know and and if you don't you don't have
[[6189.52]]any right to like ring your hands with
[[6195.0]]how like you know bad things are yeah
[[6199.8]]and then I just wanted to know one more
[[6204.96]]one more thing just for um says um uh
[[6209.64]]met you know you can you kind of
[[6212.0]]mentioned the the big companies being
[[6215.68]]Microsoft Google meta um is worth noting
[[6220.52]]meta is on the open source side of this
[[6225.48]]um and so meta's meta's actually working
[[6229.36]]quite hard and this is a big deal
[[6232.08]]because it's very you know contrary to
[[6235.0]]the image I think that people have a
[[6239.6]]meta over you know prior in Prior issues
[[6244.48]]you know correctly or not but um on on
[[6248.0]]the open source AI topic and on freedom
[[6251.8]]to innovate uh at least for now meta is
[[6257.2]]I think very strongly on that side so
[[6262.48]]yeah yeah yeah I think that's right it's
[[6266.96]]actually an very interesting point
[[6271.72]]in kind of I think essential for people
[[6276.84]]to understand is that the way met is
[[6281.08]]thinking about this and the way that
[[6285.6]]they're actually behaving and executing
[[6291.84]]is very similar to how Google thought
[[6298.0]]about Android um where you know their
[[6303.08]]main concern was that Apple not have a
[[6307.44]]monopoly on the smartphone you know not
[[6310.96]]so much that they make money on the
[[6314.72]]smartphone themselves um because you
[[6319.36]]know a monopoly on the smartphone on the
[[6324.12]]smartphone for Apple would mean that you
[[6328.76]]know Google's other business was in real
[[6333.44]]Jeopardy and so they ended up being kind
[[6337.48]]of an actor for good and you know
[[6340.68]]Android's been an amazing thing for the
[[6345.92]]world I think uh you know in including
[[6351.96]]getting smartphones in the hands of
[[6355.76]]people who won't be able to get them
[[6359.2]]otherwise you know all over the world
[[6364.12]]and meta is doing kind of a very similar
[[6370.28]]effort where uh you know in order to
[[6377.16]]make sure that they have um AI as a
[[6383.88]]great ingredient in their products and
[[6390.72]]services um is willing to open source it
[[6397.32]]and kind of gives their all of their
[[6403.96]]very very kind of large investment in AI
[[6410.28]]to the world um so that you know
[[6414.92]]entrepreneurs and everybody can kind of
[[6418.72]]keep them competitive even though they
[[6423.08]]don't plan to be in the business of AI
[[6427.36]]in the same way that you know like
[[6430.96]]Google is in the business of smartphones
[[6434.84]]to some extent but it's not their kind
[[6438.56]]of key business and you know meta
[[6441.96]]doesn't have a plan to be in the AI
[[6445.76]]business maybe you know to some extent
[[6450.28]]they will to but but that's not the main
[[6454.32]]goal then I would put one other company
[[6457.36]]on the concerning side on this and I
[[6460.24]]it's too early to tell but um where
[[6463.44]]they're going to shake out but um you
[[6466.68]]know Amazon just announced they're
[[6470.16]]investing a lot more money in anthropic
[[6474.04]]um so I think they're now basically
[[6477.88]]Amazon is to anthropic what Microsoft is
[[6483.24]]to open AI um yeah I think that's Poss
[[6489.16]]yep yep yeah and so like there there's
[[6494.52]]there's a um put anthropic is very much
[[6498.8]]in the group of kind of big Tech you
[[6501.72]]know kind of new incumbent big Tech you
[[6504.44]]know lobbying very aggressively for
[[6508.0]]regulation and Regulatory capture uh in
[[6511.96]]DC and so I I think it's it's sort of an
[[6515.04]]open question whether Amazon is going to
[[6519.24]]pick up that agenda as open as Tropic in
[[6523.64]]chly becomes effectively a subsidiary
[[6527.6]]subsidiary of Amazon yeah well this is
[[6532.0]]another place where we're on the site of
[[6537.16]]um Washington DC and in the Curr current
[[6542.4]]regulatory motion where you know the big
[[6547.56]]tech companies have done this thing um
[[6553.88]]which we thought was illegal because uh
[[6559.32]]we we observed it occur at AOL and
[[6563.72]]people went to jail but what they've
[[6568.52]]done is they they invest in startups you
[[6573.2]]know huge amounts of money Microsoft and
[[6577.56]]Amazon and Google are all doing it um
[[6582.8]]you know like billion of dollars uh with
[[6587.36]]the requirement with the explicit
[[6591.56]]requirement that those companies then
[[6599.12]]buy gpus from them um at like not the
[[6605.88]]the discount that they'd ordinarily get
[[6611.12]]but at a a relatively high price um and
[[6618.92]]then be in their clouds so um that kind
[[6625.0]]of and then you know in the Microsoft
[[6628.04]]case even more aggressive give me your
[[6632.52]]source code give me your weights um you
[[6638.68]]know which is like extremely aggressive
[[6644.28]]so you know they're moving money from
[[6650.68]]the balance sheet to their p&l um you
[[6656.48]]know in a way that at least from an
[[6660.0]]accounting standpoint it was our
[[6664.28]]understanding wasn't legal and pftc is
[[6668.84]]you know looking at that now but it
[[6672.16]]it'll be interesting to see how that
[[6675.92]]plays out yeah well the other is that's
[[6679.64]]one area another issue you know that
[[6683.12]]people should watch is um you know
[[6686.24]]that's one that's around tripping the
[[6689.68]]other one is just consolidation um you
[[6694.44]]know if you own you know half of a
[[6699.08]]company um and you get to appoint the
[[6705.48]]management team yeah um like is that you
[[6711.08]]know is that a sub like is that not a
[[6714.28]]subsidiary you know there are rules on
[[6717.88]]that like at what point you you own the
[[6723.08]]company Equity you own the intellectual
[[6729.12]]property of the company um and you
[[6734.24]]control the management team yeah is that
[[6738.88]]not your company yeah and then at that
[[6742.36]]point if you're not consolidating it
[[6745.04]]like is that legal and so the SEC is
[[6747.96]]going to win on that and then of course
[[6750.48]]you know to the extent that some of
[[6752.76]]these companies have nonprofit
[[6755.52]]components to them there's you know tax
[[6758.36]]implications to the conversion to
[[6761.04]]for-profit and
[[6763.96]]so forth and so like there there's a lot
[[6768.32]]of yeah this this this yeah the stakes
[[6773.52]]the stakes in the legal I say the stakes
[[6777.48]]in the legal Regulatory and political
[[6780.36]]game that's being played here I think
[[6784.76]]are quite quite High quite High
[[6790.76]]yes yes Ben I Ben and I has been
[[6794.64]]mentioned as been and I are old enough
[[6796.84]]where we do know a bunch of people who G
[[6801.24]]on to jail um so some some of these
[[6806.52]]issues turn out to be serious um so
[[6810.4]]Gabriel asks uh what would happen if
[[6814.12]]there was Zero regulation of AI The Good
[[6818.04]]the Bad and the Ugly and this is um this
[[6821.52]]is actually really important topic so
[[6824.48]]you know we're we're we're vigorously
[[6828.44]]arguing you know in DC um that there
[[6832.68]]should be you know basically uh uh
[[6836.08]]anybody should be completely capable of
[[6839.64]]building Ai and deploying AI big
[[6842.68]]companies should be allowed to do it
[[6844.96]]small companies should be allowed to do
[[6847.4]]it open source should be allowed to do
[[6850.8]]it um and you know look a lot of the
[[6854.2]]regulatory pushes we've been discussing
[[6856.72]]that comes from the big companies and
[[6859.52]]from the activist is to is to prevent
[[6862.16]]that from happening and put everything
[[6865.84]]in the hands of the big companies um so
[[6869.56]]you know we're definitely on the side of
[[6872.04]]freedom to innovate you know having said
[[6875.44]]that you know that's not the same as
[[6879.76]]saying no regulations of anything ever
[[6883.48]]um and so we're we're definitely not
[[6886.28]]approaching this with kind of a hardcore
[[6890.2]]libertarian lens um the interesting
[[6895.04]]thing about regulation of AI is that it
[[6898.8]]it turns out when you kind of go down
[[6902.8]]the list of the things that I would say
[[6907.96]]um reasonable people kind of uh you know
[[6912.64]]kind of you know kind of sort of uh you
[[6917.12]]know thoughtful people consider to be
[[6921.4]]concerns around AI on on both sides of
[[6926.68]]the aisle um basically the implications
[[6931.44]]that they're worried about are less the
[[6935.44]]technology itself um and are more the
[[6939.96]]the use of the technology um in practice
[[6943.56]]uh either for good or for bad and so you
[[6947.16]]know Ben you you brought up for example
[[6950.96]]um if AI is making decisions on things
[[6956.08]]like uh granting credit or mortgages or
[[6960.64]]Insurance then you know there there are
[[6963.52]]very serious policy issues around you
[[6966.6]]know who how those answers are derived
[[6969.24]]at which groups are affected in
[[6972.96]]different ways um you know the flip side
[[6977.36]]is you know if AI is used to plan a
[[6981.32]]crime um you know or to uh you know plan
[[6985.36]]a bank robber or something like that or
[[6989.6]]terrorist attack um you know that's that
[[6993.12]]you know that's obviously something that
[[6995.56]]people focused on National Security Law
[[6999.24]]Enforcement are very concerned about um
[[7002.64]]look our approach on this is actually
[[7005.64]]very straightforward which is um it it
[[7009.04]]seems like completely reasonable to
[[7013.2]]regulate uses of AI um you know and
[[7017.12]]things that would be in things that
[[7019.84]]would be dangerous now the interesting
[[7023.28]]thing about that is as far as I can tell
[[7026.2]]and I've been talking to a lot of people
[[7029.2]]in DC about this as far as I can tell
[[7033.4]]every single use of AI to do something
[[7037.68]]bad um is already illegal under current
[[7042.36]]laws U and regulations um and so it's
[[7046.8]]already illegal to be discriminatory and
[[7050.8]]lending it's already illegal to redline
[[7054.68]]in mortgages it's already illegal to
[[7058.56]]plan bank robberies it's already illegal
[[7063.2]]to plan terrorist attacks um like these
[[7067.08]]things are already illegal and there's
[[7070.16]]you know decades or centuries of case
[[7074.0]]law and regulation um and you know law
[[7077.2]]enforcement and intelligence
[[7080.6]]capabilities around all of these um and
[[7084.88]]so to be clear like we think it's like
[[7088.0]]completely appropriate that those
[[7090.6]]authorities be used and if there are new
[[7093.68]]laws or regulations needed due to you
[[7096.88]]know other bad uses that that that makes
[[7100.48]]total sense but that basically the
[[7103.96]]issues that people are worried about can
[[7106.76]]be contained in controll the level of
[[7110.4]]the use as opposed to somehow saying you
[[7114.48]]know by the way as some of the Doomer
[[7118.76]]activists do you know we need to Lally
[[7122.4]]prevent people from you know doing
[[7125.92]]linear linear algebra on their
[[7130.32]]computers yeah well I think that's
[[7135.52]]important to point out like what is AI
[[7142.0]]and it turns out to be you know it's
[[7148.0]]math um and and specifically kind of
[[7153.32]]like a mathematical model so you can
[[7158.12]]think of it for those of you who study
[[7162.2]]math in school you know in math you can
[[7166.56]]have an equation like you know yal X2
[[7172.32]]plus b or something and that equation
[[7178.44]]can kind of model the behavior of
[[7183.28]]something in physics or you know
[[7187.36]]something in the real world and so that
[[7192.68]]you can predict um you know something
[[7198.12]]happening uh like the speed that an
[[7203.16]]object will drop or so forth and so on
[[7208.8]]and then AI is kind of that but with
[[7214.4]]huge computer power applied so that you
[[7219.12]]can have much bigger equations with you
[[7223.0]]know instead of two or three or four
[[7228.2]]variables you could have you know 300
[[7232.88]]billion
[[7237.04]]variables and so if you get into the
[[7241.2]]challenge with that of course is if you
[[7245.44]]get into regulating math and you say
[[7250.64]]well math is okay up to a certain number
[[7256.16]]of variables but then at the you know
[[7261.88]]two billionth and first variable then
[[7267.76]]it's dangerous uh then you're into like
[[7273.56]]a pretty bad place and that you're going
[[7278.4]]to prevent everything good from the
[[7283.48]]technology uh from happening as as well
[[7288.0]]as anything that you might think is bad
[[7291.64]]so you really do want to be in the
[[7295.56]]business of regulating the kind of
[[7299.88]]applications of the technology not the
[[7304.8]]math in the same way that you know you
[[7310.8]]would have wanted to like nuclear power
[[7316.6]]is very uh potentially dangerous as
[[7321.44]]nuclear weapons are extremely dangerous
[[7326.52]]you wouldn't want to kind of put
[[7331.36]]parameters around what physics you could
[[7336.56]]study in order to you know like
[[7341.4]]literally in the abstract in order to
[[7345.08]]kind of prevent somebody from getting a
[[7349.24]]nuke like you can no longer study
[[7354.84]]Physics in Iran because then you might
[[7359.92]]be able to build a nuke would be kind of
[[7365.72]]the conclusion uh and you know that has
[[7372.44]]been kind of what big Tech has been
[[7377.4]]pushing for not because they want safety
[[7381.96]]but because you know again they want a
[[7386.36]]monopoly and so I think we have to be
[[7390.72]]very very careful not to do that I do
[[7394.72]]think there there will probably be you
[[7398.0]]know some cases that come up that are
[[7402.48]]enabled by AI new applications that do
[[7407.16]]need to be you know regulated
[[7413.0]]potentially um you know for example uh I
[[7419.2]]don't know that there's a law
[[7424.4]]that like if you recreate like something
[[7430.28]]that sounds exactly like Drake and then
[[7435.2]]you kind of put out a song that sounds
[[7439.4]]like a Drake song like I I don't know
[[7443.0]]that that's illegal maybe that should be
[[7446.12]]illegal I think those things need to be
[[7451.4]]considered uh for sure um and you know
[[7456.88]]there there's certainly danger in that I
[[7460.24]]also think we need technological
[[7464.32]]solutions not just regulatory solutions
[[7469.8]]for things like deep fakes um that kind
[[7475.0]]of help us get to you know what's human
[[7479.64]]what's not human and interesting a lot
[[7485.08]]of those are uh kind of um you know
[[7490.28]]viable now based on kind of blockchain
[[7495.2]]crypto technology yeah so let's uh yeah
[[7499.32]]just on the voice thing real quick yeah
[[7501.92]]so it actually I believe this to be the
[[7504.8]]case it is not currently possible to
[[7510.0]]copyright a voice yeah um right you can
[[7515.24]]copyright lyrics and you can cop
[[7519.2]]copyright music and you can copyright
[[7525.28]]Tunes um right Melodies and so forth um
[[7531.2]]copyright of voice um and yeah that that
[[7534.84]]seems like a perfect example where that
[[7537.68]]it seems like that probably is a good
[[7540.44]]idea to have a that let you Cate your
[[7544.24]]voice yeah I feel that way you know
[[7548.68]]particularly if you know people call
[[7552.88]]their voice Drake squared or something
[[7557.28]]right like you know it could get very
[[7561.36]]dodgy again you know you get again it's
[[7564.56]]just the details you know trade
[[7568.48]]trademark you can trademark your name um
[[7571.92]]so you could you could probably
[[7574.04]]prosecute on that but by by the way
[[7576.72]]having said that look this also gets to
[[7580.36]]the the complexity of these things that
[[7583.6]]there is actually an issue around
[[7586.16]]copyrighting of voice which is okay well
[[7589.24]]how close to the how close to the voice
[[7593.56]]of Drake does like there are a lot of
[[7597.84]]people who have like a lot of voices in
[[7600.6]]the world and like how close do you have
[[7603.16]]to get before you're violating copyright
[[7605.8]]and what if my natural voice actually
[[7608.68]]sounds like Drake like am I now in
[[7612.96]]trouble right and do I Outlaw like Jamie
[[7617.68]]Fox imitating crcy Jones and that kind
[[7622.24]]of thing right exactly so so anyway yeah
[[7626.0]]I me but I mean look I I you know
[[7628.6]]agreeing violently with you on this is
[[7631.48]]like that seems like a great topic uh
[[7634.2]]that needs to be taken up and take you
[[7637.08]]looked at seriously from a from a legal
[[7640.92]]standpoint um that is sort is actually
[[7644.72]]you know is obviously exact you know
[[7647.68]]sort of an issue that's sort of elevated
[[7650.68]]by AI but it's a is a general kind of
[[7654.24]]concept of like able to copyright
[[7657.56]]trademark things which has a long
[[7661.76]]history and law yeah for sure um yeah so
[[7665.88]]let's talk about the decentralization
[[7669.8]]and the blockchain aspects of this um so
[[7674.76]]uh want to get into this so Goose asks
[[7678.36]]how important is the development of
[[7682.12]]decentralized AI uh and how can the
[[7686.0]]private sector catalyze prudent and
[[7689.68]]pragmatic regulations to uh ensure us
[[7693.4]]retains Innovation leadership in this
[[7696.64]]space so yeah let's so let's Ben let's
[[7699.92]]talk about uh well let's talk about
[[7702.8]]decentralized Ai and then maybe I'll
[[7705.56]]just I'll highlight real quick and then
[[7709.08]]you you can build on it um decentralized
[[7713.12]]AI like you know the the sort of default
[[7716.68]]way that AI systems are being built uh
[[7720.16]]today is with basically you
[[7724.44]]supercomputer clusters in a cloud um and
[[7728.28]]so you'll have a single data center
[[7731.2]]somewhere that's got you know 10,000 or
[[7734.44]]100,000 ships and then a whole bunch of
[[7737.4]]systems to interconnect them and make
[[7740.68]]them all work um and then you have a
[[7744.6]]company you know that um you know
[[7748.32]]basically you know own owns and controls
[[7752.04]]that um uh and you know these and you
[[7755.08]]know these companies AI companies are
[[7757.48]]raising a lot of money to do that now
[[7760.64]]these are very large scale centralized
[[7764.56]]um you know kinds of operations and you
[[7767.88]]know to train a you know
[[7770.36]]state-of-the-art model you're at $100
[[7773.96]]million plus you know to train a you
[[7777.88]]know a big one to train a small one like
[[7780.52]]like the datab bricks model that just
[[7782.6]]came out it's like on the order of $10
[[7785.48]]million and so that you know these are
[[7789.0]]large centralized efforts and by the way
[[7792.2]]we we all think that the big models are
[[7795.24]]going to end up costing a billion you
[[7799.68]]know and up in the in in the future um
[[7804.4]]and so so then this raised the question
[[7807.6]]of like is there an alternate way to do
[[7810.72]]this and the alternate way to do this is
[[7813.88]]with we we believe strongly is with a
[[7817.32]]decentralized approach and in particular
[[7821.08]]with a blockchain based approach it's
[[7823.8]]actually the kind of thing that the
[[7826.72]]blockchain web 3 kind of method you know
[[7830.64]]seems like it would work with very well
[[7834.2]]um and in fact we are already blocking
[[7837.12]]uh backing companies and startups that
[[7839.76]]are doing this and
[[7842.44]]I would say there's at least three kind
[[7845.48]]of obvious layers that you could
[[7849.16]]decentralize um that seem like they're
[[7852.44]]increasingly important so one is the
[[7855.88]]training layer uh well actually let me
[[7860.04]]say four there's the training layer uh
[[7863.32]]which is you know building the model
[[7866.0]]there's the inference layer which is the
[[7869.32]]running the model to answer questions
[[7873.44]]there's the data layer uh B to your
[[7877.36]]point on on on opening up the black box
[[7880.28]]of where the data is coming from which
[[7882.76]]is there should probably be a blockchain
[[7885.48]]based system where people who own data
[[7889.52]]can contribute it um for for training of
[[7893.44]]AI and then get paid for it and where
[[7897.68]]you track all that um and then there's a
[[7902.48]]fourth that you alluded to which is uh
[[7907.28]]deep fakes um it it seems obvious to us
[[7912.64]]that the answer to uh deep fakes and I
[[7916.32]]should I should pause for a second and
[[7920.32]]say in my last three months of trips to
[[7925.0]]DC the number one issue politicians are
[[7930.08]]focused on with AI is deep picks could
[[7935.24]]the it's the one it's the one that
[[7938.6]]directly affects them and I I think
[[7941.44]]every politician right now who's thought
[[7945.04]]about this has a nightmare scenario of
[[7948.48]]you know it's three days before their
[[7951.48]]re-election campaign you know three
[[7955.2]]three days before the vote and a defect
[[7958.2]]goes out with them you know saying
[[7960.6]]something absolutely horrible and it's
[[7963.84]]so good and the voters get confused and
[[7967.12]]like and then they lose the election on
[[7970.44]]that and so I would say like that's
[[7973.64]]actually the thing that's that's the
[[7976.32]]thing that actually has the most potency
[[7980.56]]right now um and then you know the what
[[7984.56]]what what basically a lot of people say
[[7986.92]]including the politicians is so
[[7989.56]]therefore we need basically a way to
[[7993.6]]detect deep fakes um and so either the
[[7998.2]]AI systems need to Watermark AI
[[8001.52]]generated content so that you can tell
[[8004.16]]that it's a deep fake or you need these
[[8007.76]]kind of scanners like the scanners that
[[8011.4]]are being used in some schools now to
[[8014.12]]try to detect that something was a
[[8018.4]]generated um our view as you know I
[[8022.56]]would say both technologists and
[[8025.68]]investors in the space is that the
[[8029.8]]methods of attack of of detecting AI
[[8033.6]]generated content after the fact are
[[8037.12]]basically not going to work um and
[[8040.92]]they're not going to work because uh AI
[[8045.76]]is already too good uh at at doing this
[[8050.6]]um and by the way for example if if
[[8053.76]]youve if you have if you happen to have
[[8056.72]]kids that are uh in a school and they're
[[8059.8]]they're running one of these uh scanner
[[8063.08]]programs that is supposed to detect
[[8067.12]]whether your kid is submitting an essay
[[8070.6]]that you you where you use Chad GP to
[[8073.56]]write the essay like those really don't
[[8076.72]]work in a reliable way and there's
[[8079.4]]there's a lot of both false positives
[[8081.8]]and false negatives off of those that
[[8084.84]]are are very bad so those are actually
[[8089.24]]very bad ideas um and and for the same
[[8093.68]]same reason like uh detection of AI
[[8097.52]]generated photos and videos and and and
[[8101.28]]and speech uh is not going to be
[[8104.76]]possible and so our our view is you have
[[8108.4]]to flip the problem uh you have to
[[8111.72]]invert the problem and what you have to
[[8114.8]]do instead is basically have a system in
[[8119.32]]which uh real people can certify um that
[[8125.16]]content about them is real um we content
[[8130.92]]has Providence as well where go ahead
[[8134.64]]Ben go ahead and describe how that would
[[8139.64]]work yeah so um you know we have like
[[8146.0]]you know one of the amazing things about
[[8150.88]]crypto blockchain is it deploys
[[8154.84]]something known as a public key
[[8158.72]]infrastructure which enables kind of
[[8164.04]]every human to have a key that's unique
[[8169.56]]to them where they can sign so like if I
[[8174.92]]was in a video um or in a photo or I
[[8179.92]]wrote something I can certify that yes
[[8184.0]]this is exactly what I wrote and you
[[8188.24]]cannot alter it um to make it into
[[8193.24]]something else um it is just exactly
[[8200.88]]that and then um you know as that thing
[[8208.56]]you know gets transferred through the
[[8212.8]]world let's let's say that it's
[[8215.88]]something you know like a song that you
[[8219.8]]sell and so forth you can track just
[[8225.44]]like with a you know in a in a less
[[8230.44]]precise way but with a work of art we
[[8234.48]]track the provenance or with a house who
[[8239.12]]owned it before you and so forth that's
[[8243.84]]also like an easy application on the
[[8248.68]]blockchain and so that you know com
[[8253.52]]combination of capabilities can make
[[8259.8]]this whole uh kind of program much more
[[8265.88]]viable in terms of like okay knowing
[[8269.88]]what's real what's fake where it came
[[8273.32]]from you know where it started where
[[8279.4]]it's going and so forth I you know kind
[[8286.28]]of going back the data one I think is
[[8290.92]]really really important and that
[[8295.88]]um you know these these systems you know
[[8299.84]]one of the things that they've done
[[8303.08]]that's I would say
[[8307.72]]dodgy um and you know there have been
[[8312.56]]like big push back against it with you
[[8318.6]]know Elon trying to lock down Twitter um
[[8324.8]]and the New York Times suing open Ai and
[[8329.44]]so forth you know these systems have
[[8334.12]]gone out and just slurped in data from
[[8339.36]]all over the internet and all over kind
[[8345.32]]of you know you people's businesses and
[[8351.8]]so forth and train their models on them
[[8359.4]]um and you know I think that there's a
[[8366.2]]question of whether the people who
[[8370.68]]created that data should have any say in
[[8375.08]]whether the models trained on that data
[[8379.48]]uh and you know blockchain is an
[[8383.36]]unbelievably great system for this
[[8387.56]]because you can permission people to use
[[8392.2]]it you can charge them a fee um it can
[[8397.48]]be all automated uh in a way where you
[[8402.56]]can say sure come train you know and I
[[8406.56]]think training data ought to be of this
[[8410.68]]nature where there's a data Marketplace
[[8414.72]]and people can say yes take this data
[[8418.08]]for free I want the model to have this
[[8421.8]]knowledge or no you can't have it for
[[8425.52]]free but you can have it or no you can't
[[8429.72]]have it at all um rather than you know
[[8433.76]]what's gone on which is this very
[[8438.32]]aggressive scraping um um and you know
[[8442.92]]like you have these very smart models
[[8445.76]]where these companies are making
[[8449.44]]enormous amounts of money um taken from
[[8455.08]]data that um certainly didn't belong to
[[8459.84]]them you know maybe it's in the public
[[8463.96]]domain or what have you but you know
[[8469.08]]that that ought to be an explicit
[[8473.76]]relationship and it's not today and
[[8479.08]]that's a a a very great blockchain
[[8484.16]]solution you know and you part of the
[[8487.76]]reason we need the correct regulation on
[[8492.56]]blockchain and we need the secs to stop
[[8497.6]]harassing and terrorizing get up people
[[8502.8]]trying to innovate in this category um
[[8507.56]]and so that's kind of the second
[[8510.56]]category and then you have like training
[[8515.04]]and inference and I would say you know
[[8520.96]]right now the push against kind of
[[8525.96]]decentralized training and inference is
[[8530.68]]well you know you need this very fast
[[8535.08]]interconnect and you need it to all be
[[8538.04]]in one place
[[8541.28]]technologically but and and I think
[[8545.28]]that's true for people who have more
[[8549.84]]money than time right um which is like
[[8553.92]]you know startups and big companies and
[[8558.36]]so forth but for people in Academia
[[8562.76]]who have more time than money they're
[[8567.08]]getting completely frozen out of AI
[[8572.56]]research you can't do there's not enough
[[8578.24]]money in all of Academia to participate
[[8585.0]]anymore in AI research and so you know
[[8591.16]]having a decentralized approach where
[[8596.4]]you can share you know all the gpus
[[8601.4]]across your network and hey yeah maybe
[[8605.12]]it takes a lot longer to train your
[[8609.4]]networker to serve it but you know what
[[8614.2]]you still can do your research you can
[[8619.44]]still innovate you know create new ideas
[[8624.92]]do architectures and test them out at
[[8630.08]]Large Scale um which you know will be
[[8635.32]]amazing if we can do it and again we
[[8641.64]]need um you know the SEC to stop you
[[8647.76]]know kind of illegally terrorizing every
[[8652.96]]crypto company and trying to block laws
[[8658.4]]from being put in place that help us you
[[8663.52]]know enable this yeah there's actually a
[[8667.96]]really and you alluded to at the college
[[8671.88]]thing actually really matters so um we
[[8676.28]]have a friend uh you know who runs one
[[8679.88]]of you know is very involved in one of
[[8682.76]]the big computer science programs one of
[[8685.56]]the major American Research universities
[[8687.96]]and of course by the way a lot of the
[[8690.24]]technology we're talking about was
[[8693.2]]developed at American Research
[[8698.08]]universities absolutely and and Canadian
[[8702.96]]ones too Toronto Canadian ones and
[[8706.4]]European ones exactly uh you know
[[8709.8]]historically as with every other wave of
[[8712.8]]technology in the last you know whatever
[[8715.6]]hundred years you know the research our
[[8718.84]]research universities you know across
[[8721.92]]these countries have been kind of the
[[8724.64]]the gems of the of the you know the
[[8727.76]]Wellsprings of of a lot of the new
[[8731.0]]technology that have ended up powering
[[8733.76]]you know the you know the economy and
[[8737.48]]everything else around us you know we
[[8741.12]]have a friend involved in running one of
[[8744.08]]these and this friend said a while ago
[[8748.4]]that he he said that um the um you know
[[8752.32]]his concern was that his university
[[8756.6]]would be unable to uh fund a uh
[[8762.2]]competitive AI cluster basically so you
[[8766.72]]know a compute grid um that would
[[8770.2]]actually let students and professors at
[[8774.24]]that University actually work in AI um
[[8777.56]]because it's now getting to be too
[[8780.32]]expensive and research and and
[[8783.84]]universities are just not funded to do
[[8788.04]]do have capex programs that big um and
[[8791.84]]then he said his his concern more
[[8794.4]]recently has been all research
[[8797.0]]universities together might not be able
[[8801.04]]to afford uh to to do that which means
[[8805.84]]all universities together might not be
[[8809.6]]able to um actually have you know
[[8813.24]]basically Cutting Edge AI work uh
[[8817.52]]happening on the University side um and
[[8821.16]]then I I happen to have a convers I was
[[8824.36]]in DC I was in a bipartisan uh you know
[[8829.0]]house uh a meeting um the other day with
[[8833.48]]uh on these AI topics and one and
[[8836.28]]actually one of the one of the in this
[[8839.28]]case Democratic Congress Congress women
[[8843.12]]asked me you know the question which you
[[8846.48]]know comes up which is a very serious
[[8849.36]]question always right which is how do
[[8852.72]]you get kind of more more members of
[[8856.2]]unrepresented groups underrepresented
[[8860.28]]groups involved in Tech and you know I
[[8864.68]]found myself giving the same answer that
[[8868.44]]I always give on that which is you you
[[8871.72]]you you the most effective thing you
[[8874.28]]need to do is you need to go upstream
[[8876.6]]and you need to have more people coming
[[8879.24]]out of you know college with computer
[[8882.84]]science degrees um who are you know
[[8887.2]]skilled and qualified and trained right
[[8890.96]]and mentored in to be able to
[[8893.76]]participate in the industry and you know
[[8896.96]]that's you know you you and I Ben both
[[8901.2]]came out of state schools um you know
[[8904.76]]with uh you know with computer science
[[8907.76]]programs um that you know where we were
[[8911.64]]able to then have the careers we've had
[[8915.32]]um and so you know I find myself
[[8918.0]]answering the question saying well we
[[8920.48]]need we need more computer science you
[[8923.16]]know graduates from from all all you
[[8925.64]]know from every from every group and
[[8928.04]]then but in the back of my head I was
[[8930.6]]like and it's going to be impossible to
[[8933.72]]do that because none of these places are
[[8936.84]]going to be able to afford to actually
[[8939.64]]have the computer resources to be able
[[8942.52]]to actually have ai programs in the
[[8947.48]]future um and so like you know maybe the
[[8952.56]]government can fix this by just dumping
[[8955.48]]a ton of money on top of these
[[8958.72]]universities and maybe that's what will
[[8962.84]]happen and you know the current
[[8966.6]]political environment seems like maybe
[[8970.28]]it's not quite feasible um for a variety
[[8974.2]]of reasons and then and then the the
[[8977.48]]other approach would be a decentral Iz
[[8980.84]]approach would be a blockchain
[[8984.72]]blockchain based approach that everybody
[[8988.2]]that everybody could participate in you
[[8990.8]]know if if that were something that the
[[8993.64]]government will were willing to support
[[8996.92]]which right now it's it's not and so I I
[[9000.36]]think there's a really really really
[[9003.88]]really Central important vital issue
[[9007.92]]here um that I think you know I think um
[[9011.44]]is being glossed over by a lot of people
[[9014.64]]that I think should really be looked at
[[9018.4]]yeah no I I I think it's absolutely
[[9022.2]]critical you know and this is you know
[[9025.84]]again kind of going back to our original
[[9030.08]]thing like it's so important to the
[[9035.24]]country um being what you know America
[[9040.52]]being America should be to get these
[[9046.04]]issues right and we're we're definitely
[[9051.08]]in danger of that not happening you know
[[9055.56]]because you know look I think people are
[[9060.04]]taking much too narrow a view of some of
[[9064.56]]these Technologies and not understanding
[[9069.16]]their full capabilities and you know we
[[9075.12]]get into oh the AI could you know say
[[9080.96]]something racist therefore we won't cure
[[9084.6]]cancer I mean like we're getting into
[[9090.16]]that kind of dumb idea and uh you know
[[9097.44]]we need to have a tech forward kind of
[[9102.2]]solution to some of these things and
[[9106.84]]then the right regulatory approach to to
[[9111.8]]kind of make the whole environment
[[9116.04]]work so yeah let's go into that next the
[[9119.72]]next phase of this now which is the the
[[9123.8]]sort of global implications so um I'm
[[9127.76]]going to conjoin two different topics
[[9130.24]]here but I'm going to do it on purpose
[[9133.4]]so Michael Frank Martin asks what could
[[9136.96]]the US do to position itself as the
[[9140.68]]global leader of Open Source software do
[[9144.24]]you see any specific legislation or
[[9146.72]]regulatory constraints that are
[[9149.28]]hampering the development of Open Source
[[9153.28]]projects um Arta asks similar question
[[9158.0]]what would an ideal AI policy for open
[[9162.0]]source software models looks like um and
[[9165.52]]then Sarah Holmes asks the China
[[9169.32]]question um do you think we will end up
[[9173.12]]with two AI Tech Stacks the west and
[[9176.32]]China and ultimately companies will have
[[9180.96]]to pick one side and stay on it and so
[[9185.64]]look I would say this is where you get
[[9188.44]]to like the really really big
[[9191.76]]geopolitical long-term issue which is
[[9196.24]]basically my understanding of things is
[[9200.84]]is is sort of as follows which is you
[[9205.2]]know basically the the for a variety of
[[9208.8]]reasons technological development in the
[[9211.36]]west is being centralized into the
[[9214.0]]United States you know with with you
[[9216.88]]know some in Canada and some in Europe
[[9220.08]]although you know quite frankly a lot of
[[9223.52]]lot of the best Canadian and you know
[[9226.8]]European you know Tech Founders are
[[9229.8]]coming to Silicon Valley you know Yan
[[9233.48]]Lon you know teaches Yan Lun is you know
[[9237.56]]a hero in France teaches at NYU and
[[9241.16]]works at meta both of which are American
[[9244.28]]institutions and so they're they're sort
[[9247.2]]of an American or let's say American
[[9251.16]]plus European kind of you know kind of
[[9255.6]]kind of uh you know sort of tech
[[9259.56]]Vanguard wedge in the world and then and
[[9264.36]]then there's China um and and and and
[[9269.08]]really it's it's it's actually quite a
[[9273.6]]bipolar uh situation um you know it it
[[9277.76]]would say you know the dreams Tech being
[[9280.56]]fully democratized and spreading you
[[9283.4]]know throughout the world have been
[[9286.72]]realized for sure on the on the youth
[[9290.52]]side but you know not nearly as much on
[[9294.08]]the entrepreneurship side or the
[[9297.64]]invention side um and again immigration
[[9300.84]]you know immigration being a great you
[[9303.84]]know virtue uh but um you know for the
[[9306.92]]countries that are the beneficiaries of
[[9309.92]]immigration the other side of that is
[[9312.96]]you know it makes you know other
[[9315.04]]countries are going to be less
[[9316.96]]competitive because they're their best
[[9321.08]]and brightest moving to the US so so
[[9326.16]]anyway so we are in a bipolar we are in
[[9329.96]]a bipolar Tech world is primarily a
[[9333.16]]bipolar Tech world it's primarily the US
[[9336.92]]and China um you know this is not the
[[9341.08]]first time we have been in a bipolar
[[9345.64]]World involving you know geopolitics and
[[9351.56]]Technology um you know there the US and
[[9358.4]]China have two very different systems um
[[9364.4]]uh the Chinese system has all of the
[[9368.68]]virtues and downsides of being
[[9372.8]]centralized um the US system has all the
[[9377.4]]virtues and downsides of being more
[[9382.36]]decentralized um there is a very
[[9386.88]]different set of views uh of the two
[[9390.88]]systems on how Society should be ordered
[[9395.36]]and what Freedom means um and you know
[[9399.16]]what people should be able to do and not
[[9403.36]]do and then look both the US and China
[[9408.72]]have visions of global Supremacy and
[[9413.88]]visions of basically car and agendas and
[[9418.52]]programs uh you know to carry forward
[[9422.64]]their points of view on the technology
[[9426.76]]of AI and on the societal implications
[[9431.0]]of AI uh out you know throughout the
[[9435.84]]world um and so you know there is this
[[9440.28]]cold war two oh and then the other thing
[[9445.2]]is just in in DC it's just crystal clear
[[9450.64]]that there's this now Dynamic happening
[[9454.12]]where Republicans and Democrats right
[[9457.08]]now are trying to LeapFrog each other
[[9461.36]]every day on being more anti-china um
[[9465.92]]and so you know we're our friend Neil
[[9469.28]]Ferguson is using the term I think Cold
[[9472.6]]War 2.0 like we're we're we're whether
[[9476.04]]we want to or not like we're in Cold War
[[9479.32]]2.0 like we're we're we're in a dynamic
[[9483.8]]similar to the one was with the USSR you
[[9490.6]]know 30 30 40 50 years ago um and to sah
[[9496.6]]Holmes's question it's 100% going to be
[[9501.12]]the case there are two AI Tech Stacks um
[[9505.44]]and there are two AI governance models
[[9509.32]]and there are two AI you know deployment
[[9513.4]]you know systems and you know there are
[[9517.12]]two ways in which uh you know AI duv
[[9520.52]]tails in everything from surveillance to
[[9524.08]]Smart cities to Transportation
[[9528.16]]self-driving cars drones who controls
[[9531.84]]what who gets access to what who sees
[[9535.4]]what uh the degree by the way to which
[[9538.96]]AI is used as a method for population
[[9542.44]]control um there there there are very
[[9545.8]]different Visions um and and these are
[[9549.44]]National visions and Global Visions um
[[9553.32]]and there's a very big competition
[[9557.6]]developing um and you know it it it
[[9561.32]]certainly looks to me like there's going
[[9564.72]]to be a winner and a loser um I think
[[9569.24]]it's overwhelmingly in you know our best
[[9573.84]]interest for the US to be the winner for
[[9578.72]]the US we have to lean into our
[[9583.88]]strengths um and you know our the
[[9588.56]]downside of our system is that we are
[[9592.52]]not as well organized and orchestrated
[[9596.8]]top down as China is uh the upside of
[[9601.84]]our system at least historically is that
[[9605.68]]we're we're able to benefit from
[[9608.2]]decentralization we're able to benefit
[[9611.08]]from competition from a market economy
[[9615.12]]from a private sector right uh where you
[[9619.4]]know we're able to basically have a much
[[9622.88]]larger number of smart people being you
[[9626.32]]know making lots of small decisions to
[[9629.36]]be able to get to good outcomes as
[[9632.28]]opposed to you know having a having a
[[9635.2]]dictatorial system in which there's a
[[9637.64]]small number of people trying to make
[[9640.6]]decisions I mean look and this is how we
[[9644.36]]won the Cold War against Russia is our
[[9648.08]]decentralized system just worked better
[[9651.08]]economically technologically and
[[9654.6]]ultimately militarily uh than the than
[[9659.2]]the Soviet uh centralized system and so
[[9662.92]]it just seems like fairly obvious to me
[[9665.96]]that like we we have to we have to lean
[[9668.84]]into our strengths we better lean into
[[9671.48]]our strengths and if because if we think
[[9674.04]]we're just going to be like another
[[9677.08]]version of a centralized system but
[[9680.48]]without all the advantages that China
[[9683.28]]has with having a more centralized
[[9685.68]]system you know that just seems like a
[[9688.88]]bad formula so yeah let me pause there
[[9692.6]]and B see what you think yeah I know for
[[9697.4]]sure I think that'd be dis dous um and I
[[9703.52]]think this is why it's so clear that if
[[9707.76]]there's one you know to answer the
[[9710.68]]question if there's one regulatory
[[9715.6]]policy that we would enact that would
[[9721.0]]ensure America's competitiveness it
[[9724.88]]would be open source and the reason
[[9729.72]]being that as you said um this enables
[[9735.0]]the largest number of participants to
[[9740.24]]kind of contribute to AI to innovate to
[[9745.04]]come up with novel Solutions and so
[[9748.72]]forth and I think that you're right
[[9752.12]]China's you know what's going to happen
[[9755.92]]in China is they're going to pick one
[[9761.36]]because they can um and they're going to
[[9766.24]]uh kind of drive all their wood behind
[[9769.8]]that arrow in a way that we could never
[[9774.52]]do because we just don't work that way
[[9778.96]]um and they're going to impose that on
[[9782.88]]their society and try and impose it on
[[9789.12]]the world and you know our best counter
[[9794.56]]to that is to put it in the hands of all
[[9797.84]]of our smart people I have so many smart
[[9801.08]]people from all over the world from you
[[9806.28]]know like as um we like to say diversity
[[9811.32]]is our strength we've got this
[[9814.8]]tremendous uh different points of view
[[9819.04]]different you know kind of kinds of
[[9823.96]]people in our country and you know the
[[9829.04]]more that we can enable them the more
[[9833.76]]likely we'll be competitive and I'll
[[9838.4]]give you a tremendous example of this is
[[9843.68]]um you know I think if you go back to
[[9850.08]]2017 and you read any you know foreign
[[9856.12]]policy magazine Etc there wasn't a
[[9860.48]]single one that didn't say China was
[[9864.36]]ahead in AI they have more patents they
[[9868.52]]have more students going to universities
[[9871.8]]they they're ahead in AI they're ahead
[[9875.96]]in AI like we're behind an AI
[[9880.88]]and then you know chat GPT comes out and
[[9884.92]]goes oh I guess we're not behind an AI
[[9889.32]]we're ahead of an AI and the truth of it
[[9894.52]]was what China was ahead on was in
[[9899.4]]integrating AI into the government their
[[9904.52]]one AI into their government in that way
[[9910.08]]and you know look we're working on doing
[[9914.24]]a better job of that with American
[[9919.2]]dynamism but um we're never going to be
[[9925.16]]good at that model you know where you
[[9929.0]]know that's the model that they're going
[[9931.64]]to be great at and we have to be great
[[9935.36]]at our model and if we start limiting
[[9939.8]]that outlawing startups and outlawing
[[9943.44]]anybody but the big companies from
[[9947.4]]developing Ai and all that kind of thing
[[9951.08]]uh we'll definitely shoot ourselves on
[[9954.04]]the foot I would say related or like
[[9958.2]]another kind of important point I think
[[9965.36]]in kind of the safety of the world um is
[[9972.32]]you know when you talk about two
[[9978.48]]AIS that's a like two AI Stacks um
[[9986.04]]perhaps but it's very important that uh
[[9991.56]]countries that are in America that are
[[9997.16]]in China can align AI to their values
[[10003.08]]and I'll just give you kind of one
[[10007.24]]really important example uh which you
[[10010.44]]know like I've been spending a lot of
[[10013.92]]time in the Middle East and if you look
[[10018.12]]at the kind of history of you know a
[[10022.72]]country like Saudi Arabia they're coming
[[10028.28]]from a world of fundamentalism and you
[[10033.8]]know a kind of set of values that
[[10037.68]]they're you know they're trying to
[[10040.76]]modernize they you know they've done
[[10044.76]]tremendous things with women's rights
[[10050.2]]and so forth but you know look there's
[[10056.44]]still the fact that they've got you know
[[10061.12]]people who don't want to go to that
[[10066.28]]future so fast and they need to preserve
[[10072.24]]some of their history in order to not
[[10077.36]]have a revolution or extreme violence
[[10082.72]]and so forth and yeah we're seeing Al
[[10087.64]]Qaeda re-park up in Afghanistan and all
[[10091.92]]these kinds of things uh which are by
[[10096.64]]the way Al qaa's Real Enemy of modern
[[10102.36]]Saudi just as much as they're America an
[[10109.32]]enemy of America and so if Saudi can't
[[10117.08]]Aline an AI to the current Saudi values
[[10122.56]]they could literally spark a revolution
[[10126.48]]in their country and so it's very
[[10130.8]]important that as we have technology
[[10135.92]]that we develop that it not be totally
[[10141.32]]proprietary clone source that it' be
[[10147.52]]kind of uh modifiable by our allies uh
[[10153.16]]who need to kind of progress at their
[[10157.4]]Pace to keep their kind of country safe
[[10163.68]]and keep us safe uh in doing so and so
[[10169.84]]this has got great geopolitical
[[10174.2]]ramifications what we do here like if we
[[10179.8]]go to the model that Google and
[[10185.04]]Microsoft are advocating for this
[[10189.56]]Chinese model of only a few can control
[[10195.76]]AI uh we're going to be in big trouble
[[10200.24]]yeah and then I just want to close in
[[10202.6]]the open source point because it's so
[[10206.24]]critical so this is where you know I say
[[10210.52]]I get extremely irate at the at the idea
[[10213.92]]of closing down open source which you
[[10217.72]]know people in in in a number of of
[[10221.52]]these people are are lobing for very
[[10224.72]]actively by the way I I I'm going to
[[10228.64]]name one more name yeah uh we even have
[[10232.72]]VC's lobbying to Outlaw open source
[[10235.8]]which I find to just be completely
[[10238.76]]staggering and
[[10245.36]]in V venod so ven venod kosla who is
[[10251.52]]which is this is just incredible to me
[[10254.56]]he's a founder of sun Microsystems which
[[10257.92]]was in many ways a company built on open
[[10261.24]]source uh built on open source Unix out
[[10264.44]]of Berkeley and then itself built a lot
[[10268.44]]of Open Source critical open source um
[[10272.08]]and then of course you know was the
[[10274.6]]do.com which of course you know the
[[10277.28]]internet was all built on open source
[[10280.72]]and venod has been lobbying to ban open
[[10285.6]]source AI um and by the way he denies
[[10289.48]]that he's been doing this but I saw him
[[10293.4]]do it with my own eyes uh when the US
[[10297.68]]Congressional China committee came to
[[10301.28]]Stanford um I was in the meeting where
[[10305.8]]he was with you know 30 20 or 30
[[10309.88]]congressmen and and lobbying actively
[[10313.04]]for this and so I've seen him do it
[[10316.8]]myself um and you know look he's got a
[[10320.8]]big stake in open AI you know maybe it's
[[10324.32]]Financial self-interest by the way maybe
[[10327.88]]he's a True Believer in the dangers but
[[10332.08]]in any of that well I think he proved on
[[10336.8]]Twitter he was not a True Believer in
[[10341.2]]the dangers I'll get into that I'll
[[10346.84]]explain that but yeah yeah so um so uh
[[10352.04]]yeah I mean even within even within
[[10355.08]]little Tech even within the startup
[[10358.48]]world we we we we are not uniform in
[[10361.88]]this and I I think that's extremely
[[10365.28]]dangerous open look open source like
[[10368.68]]what is open source software like open
[[10371.76]]source software is is you know it is
[[10374.2]]quite lit you know it's the
[[10376.6]]technological technological equivalent
[[10380.24]]of free speech um which means it's the
[[10383.84]]technological equivalent of free thought
[[10387.2]]and it it is the way that the software
[[10390.68]]industry has developed to be able to
[[10393.56]]build many of the most critical
[[10396.2]]components of the modern technological
[[10399.56]]World um and then Ben as you said
[[10403.76]]earlier to be able to secure those um
[[10407.44]]and to be able to have those actually be
[[10411.8]]safe and reliable um uh and then and
[[10416.16]]then to have the transparency you know
[[10419.0]]that that we've talked about so that you
[[10421.68]]know how how they work and how they're
[[10424.96]]making decisions um and then to your
[[10428.32]]last point also so that you can have
[[10431.44]]customized AI in many different
[[10434.72]]environments so you don't end up with a
[[10437.52]]world where you just have one or a
[[10440.84]]couple AIS but you actually have like a
[[10444.68]]diversity of AIS with with like lot lots
[[10447.48]]of different points of view and lots of
[[10450.76]]different capabilities um and so the the
[[10454.6]]open source fight is actually at the
[[10458.76]]core of this um and and and of course
[[10463.52]]the the reason why you know the sort of
[[10467.16]]you know sort of people with an eye
[[10469.92]]towards Monopoly or cartel want to ban
[[10472.48]]this as open source is a tremendous
[[10475.56]]threat to Monopoly or cartel like you
[[10478.64]]know in many ways is a guarantee that
[[10482.4]]Monopoly or cartel can't last um but it
[[10487.28]]is absolutely 100% you know required for
[[10491.72]]the you know for the furtherance of
[[10495.68]]number one a vibrant private sector
[[10499.44]]number two a vibrant startup sector and
[[10503.24]]then right back to the Academia Point
[[10506.88]]like without open source then at that
[[10511.24]]point you know University college kids
[[10515.6]]are just not going to be able to they're
[[10518.2]]not even GNA be able to learn how the
[[10520.04]]technology Works they're just going to
[[10523.64]]be like completely boxed out um and so a
[[10527.96]]world where open source is banned is is
[[10531.16]]bad on so many fronts it's just
[[10533.96]]incredible to me that anybody's
[[10537.0]]advocating for it it needs to be I think
[[10540.04]]this needs to be recognized as the
[[10545.24]]threat that it is yeah and on V Noe you
[[10550.76]]know it was such a funny dialogue
[[10555.52]]between you and he so like I'll just um
[[10562.12]]give quick summary of it basically uh
[[10567.48]]you know he was arguing for closed
[[10571.56]]Source you for open source his core
[[10575.88]]argument was this is the Manhattan
[[10581.2]]Project um and therefore we can't let
[[10585.92]]anybody know the secrets and you
[[10589.64]]countered that by saying well if this is
[[10593.8]]in fact the Manhattan Project then is
[[10598.88]]like you know is the open AI team um you
[[10605.52]]know locked in a remote location do they
[[10611.84]]screen all their like employees very
[[10616.52]]very carefully is it air locked are they
[[10620.28]]you know is there super high security of
[[10623.92]]course none of that is close to true in
[[10627.64]]fact quite sure they have Chinese
[[10630.92]]Nationals working there probably some
[[10634.36]]are spies for the Chinese government
[[10639.64]]there's no any kind of strong security
[[10644.84]]at open AI or at Google or at any of
[[10648.36]]these places you
[[10653.68]]know anywhere near the Manhattan project
[[10660.08]]which is where they built a whole city
[[10664.6]]that nobody knew about um so they
[[10668.28]]couldn't get into it and you know once
[[10671.52]]you caught him in that he said nothing
[[10675.0]]and then he says back well you know it
[[10678.6]]cost billions of dollars to train these
[[10682.28]]models you just want to give that away
[[10686.6]]is that good you know is that good
[[10691.16]]economics like that was his like final
[[10695.76]]Counterpoint to you which basically said
[[10699.56]]oh yeah I'm trying to preserve a
[[10702.96]]monopoly here like what are you doing
[[10707.24]]I'm an investor and and I think that's
[[10712.32]]true for for all these arguments well
[[10716.84]]the kicker you know the kicker B of that
[[10721.48]]story the kicker to that is three three
[[10727.24]]days later um the justice department
[[10731.92]]indicted a Chinese National Google
[[10735.2]]employee
[[10739.36]]yeah who stole uh Google's next
[[10743.64]]Generation AI chip designs which is
[[10747.52]]quite literally the Family Jewels uh for
[[10751.08]]an AI program it's you know it's the
[[10753.84]]equivalent of stealing the you know if
[[10756.44]]you stretch the metaphor the equivalent
[[10760.32]]of stealing the design for the bomb um
[[10765.8]]and that Google employee um uh took that
[[10770.04]]those chip downloaded them and took them
[[10774.04]]to China and by definition you know
[[10777.6]]definition that means took them in the
[[10779.56]]Chinese government because there's no
[[10782.52]]distinction in China uh between the
[[10785.68]]private sector and the government um
[[10788.36]]it's an integrated thing um the
[[10791.44]]government owns and controls everything
[[10795.52]]um and so you know 100% 100% guaranteed
[[10799.0]]that that went straight to the Chinese
[[10802.72]]government Chinese military um and
[[10807.84]]Google Google which you know like you
[[10811.56]]know Google has like a big information
[[10813.88]]security team and all the rest of it
[[10816.28]]Google did not realize according to the
[[10819.16]]indictment Google did not realize that
[[10823.32]]that uh that engineer uh had been in
[[10829.4]]China for six months yeah amazing well
[[10834.32]]hold on it gets better it gets better
[[10838.6]]this is the same Google with the same
[[10845.16]]CEO who refused to sell Google
[[10852.2]]proprietary AI technology to the US
[[10857.64]]Department of Defense so they're
[[10862.64]]supplying China with AI and not
[[10867.8]]supplying the US which is just goes back
[[10873.8]]to look if it's not open source we're
[[10880.92]]never going to compete like yeah we've
[[10887.52]]lost the future of the world right here
[[10892.68]]um which is why you know it's the single
[[10898.12]]most important issue for sure yeah and
[[10902.84]]and you're you're not going to lock this
[[10905.48]]stuff up like you're not going to lock
[[10908.12]]it up nobody's locking it up it's not
[[10911.24]]locked up these companies are security
[[10916.2]]swiss cheese um and like you know you're
[[10920.92]]not going to you know and you have a
[[10923.96]]debate about the Tactical relevance of
[[10927.04]]of Chip embargos and so forth but like
[[10930.08]]you're you're you're you're not the
[[10933.16]]horse has left the barn on this not
[[10936.36]]least because these companies are
[[10939.88]]without a doubt riddled with uh with uh
[[10942.88]]with with foreign assets and they're
[[10946.88]]very easy to penetrate um and so we we
[[10951.2]]we just have to be like I would say very
[[10954.12]]realistic about the actual state of play
[[10957.88]]here um and and and we have to we have
[[10961.44]]to we have to play in reality and we
[[10963.92]]have to we have to play in reality we
[[10967.4]]have to win in reality um and the win is
[[10971.36]]we need Innovation we need competition
[[10974.4]]we need free thought we need free speech
[[10977.08]]we need we need to embrace the virtues
[[10981.12]]of our system um and and not and not
[[10985.6]]shut ourselves down in the face of in
[[10989.76]]the face of the you know the conflicts
[[10994.64]]that are that are coming uh another one
[[10999.72]]um why are Andre Andreas asks why are
[[11004.68]]usvc so much more engaged in politics
[[11008.24]]and policy than their Global
[[11011.8]]counterparts and um I I really
[[11015.88]]appreciate that question because it
[[11020.64]]basically like if if it if that's the
[[11025.56]]question then it means that boy VCS
[[11028.96]]outside the US must not be engaged at
[[11033.96]]all because USS are engaged yeah um and
[[11038.96]]then what do you believe the impact of
[[11042.0]]this is on both the VC ecosystem and
[[11045.24]]Society in general and then related
[[11048.96]]directly related question Vincent asks
[[11053.2]]um are European AI companies becoming
[[11057.6]]less interesting investment targets for
[[11062.28]]us-based VCS due to the strict and
[[11066.44]]predictably unpredictable regulatory
[[11070.48]]landscape in Europe uh would would you
[[11074.84]]advise early stage European ax companies
[[11078.52]]to consider relocating to the us as a
[[11083.92]]result great question um well I look I
[[11090.2]]think that that it kind of goes back to
[[11095.44]]a little of what you said earlier which
[[11101.36]]is you know in startup world like
[[11107.2]]there's you know in the west there's the
[[11111.32]]United States and then there's
[[11114.44]]everywhere else and the United States is
[[11117.36]]kind of bigger than everywhere else
[[11122.96]]combined um and you know so it's natural
[[11129.0]]and look you know in these kind of
[[11133.88]]political things it kind of starts with
[[11141.08]]the leader and you know us is the leader
[[11147.56]]in VC yeah we feel like we're the
[[11153.8]]leaders in usvc so we need to go go to
[[11160.6]]Washington until we go you know nobody's
[[11166.08]]going and so that's that's a lot of the
[[11172.04]]reason why we started things I'm on Wow
[[11179.88]]on European regulatory policy look it's
[[11186.96]]uh I think I I think generally
[[11193.24]]regulatory policy is going to is likely
[[11197.96]]dictate where you can build these
[[11200.84]]companies we've seen some interesting
[[11205.36]]things um you know France turns out to
[[11211.4]]be leading a revolution in Europe on AI
[[11216.88]]regulatory where they're basically
[[11222.12]]telling the EU to pound sand um you know
[[11227.12]]and large reason because they have a
[[11231.24]]company there mrol and you know they
[[11235.96]]it's a national National Jewel for for
[[11240.24]]the country and they don't want to give
[[11245.24]]it up because you know the EU has some
[[11251.2]]crazy safetyism you know thing going on
[[11256.24]]there yeah and I also note France also
[[11259.88]]of course is playing the same role with
[[11263.72]]nuclear policy in Europe um yeah they're
[[11268.28]]the one country Europe they're they're
[[11271.64]]the cleanest country you know probably
[[11274.12]]one of the cleanest countries in the
[[11276.96]]world as a result right but it been
[[11280.52]]staunchly pronuclear um and trying to
[[11283.84]]hold off I think in a lot of ways sort
[[11287.2]]of attempts throughout the rest of
[[11290.72]]Europe and especially from Germany to to
[[11294.56]]basically bad nuclear civilian nuclear
[[11300.48]]power yeah and the UK the UK is sort of
[[11306.24]]been flip-flopping on AI policy and
[[11310.36]]we'll see where they come out and uh you
[[11314.8]]know Brussels has been ridiculous
[[11319.76]]as they've been on almost everything
[[11323.72]]yeah the big thing I think I note here
[[11326.6]]is there's a really big philosophical
[[11329.72]]distinction I think it's rooted actually
[[11332.68]]in the difference between that
[[11335.2]]traditionally it's been called I think
[[11338.4]]the sort of Anglo or anglo-american kind
[[11342.12]]of approach to to law and then the
[[11345.48]]Continental European approach and I
[[11348.56]]forget forget these it's it's like I
[[11352.64]]forget the terms for it but the
[[11358.24]]legal it's like common law and then um
[[11363.32]]yeah I think the civil
[[11367.76]]law so it's basically the difference
[[11373.4]]basically is um that which is not
[[11379.12]]outlawed is
[[11385.12]]legal or that which is specifically uh
[[11390.76]]not uh legal is legal uh and anything
[[11395.2]]that's not explicitly legal is outlawed
[[11399.16]]um right in in other words like by
[[11402.72]]default do you have freedom and then you
[[11406.92]]impose the law to have constraints or by
[[11410.88]]default do you have no ability to do
[[11414.04]]anything and then the law enables you to
[[11417.88]]do things um and these are sort of this
[[11422.36]]is like a fundamental like philosophical
[[11427.0]]legal you know uh political distinction
[[11432.24]]um and and then this this shows up in a
[[11436.32]]lot of these issues with this idea
[[11440.28]]called the precautionary principle uh
[[11444.88]]which is sort of the a rewarding of the
[[11449.12]]sort of traditional European approach um
[[11452.6]]which is basically the precautionary
[[11456.0]]principle says uh new technologies
[[11459.44]]should not be allowed to be fielded
[[11462.36]]until they are proven to be
[[11467.32]]harmless um yeah right and of course the
[[11471.96]]the precautionary principle very
[[11475.0]]specifically is is sort of a sort of a
[[11478.36]]Hallmark of of the European approach to
[[11481.88]]regulation and increasingly you know by
[[11486.52]]the US approach um and it it
[[11490.8]]specifically it's its origin it was
[[11494.36]]actually uh sort of uh described in that
[[11497.56]]way and given that name actually by the
[[11501.48]]German Greens in the 1970s to to as a
[[11507.04]]means to ban civilian nuclear power um
[[11511.32]]you know with with by the way with just
[[11513.92]]catastrophic results and we could we
[[11516.48]]could spend a lot a lot of time on that
[[11518.92]]but I think everybody at this point
[[11521.4]]agrees like including the Germans
[[11524.04]]increasingly agreed that was that was a
[[11527.6]]big mistake that among other things you
[[11531.48]]know has led to basically Europe funding
[[11535.0]]Russia's invasion of Ukraine through the
[[11538.68]]you know the need for imported energy
[[11541.36]]because they they keep shutting down
[[11544.88]]their nuclear plants um and so just like
[[11549.12]]sort of a catastrophic decision but the
[[11552.4]]the precautionary principle has become
[[11556.72]]like I would say extremely trendy like
[[11561.2]]it's one of these things like it sounds
[[11565.48]]great right it's like well why would you
[[11569.52]]Poss why would you want to be released
[[11572.08]]in the world if it's not proved to be
[[11575.36]]harmless like how can you possibly be in
[[11578.68]]support of anything that's going to
[[11581.84]]cause harm but the obvious problem of
[[11585.92]]that is with that principle you could
[[11589.6]]have never deployed Technologies such as
[[11594.8]]fire um electric power internal
[[11601.44]]combustion engines Cars airplanes the
[[11607.2]]computer right like every single piece
[[11611.44]]of technology we have the poers modern
[[11615.16]]day civilization has way in which it can
[[11619.2]]be used to hurt people right every every
[[11624.0]]single one technology Technologies are
[[11628.2]]double-edged swords there are thing you
[[11631.64]]know you can you can use fire uh to
[[11634.76]]protect your village or to attack the
[[11637.24]]neighboring Village like you know the
[[11640.28]]these things can be used in in in in in
[[11645.4]]both different ways um and so basically
[[11650.28]]if we had applied the precautionary
[[11653.6]]principle historically we would not have
[[11656.72]]you know we would still be living in mud
[[11659.64]]Huts we would be just like absolutely
[[11663.28]]miserable Mis miserable and so the idea
[[11666.64]]of imposing the precautionary principle
[[11669.92]]today if you're coming from like an
[[11673.64]]Anglo you know American kind of you know
[[11676.76]]perspective or from a freedom to
[[11679.52]]innovate you know perspective that's
[[11682.56]]just like that's just like incredibly
[[11686.4]]horrifying um the you know she basically
[[11691.28]]guaranteed to stall out progress um you
[[11695.8]]know this is very much the mentality of
[[11699.8]]the EU bureaucrats in particular um and
[[11703.2]]this is the mentality behind a lot of
[[11706.32]]their recent legislation on on on
[[11711.2]]technology issues um France is is does
[[11715.36]]seem to be the main counterweight
[[11718.36]]against this in in the in Europe um you
[[11721.88]]know Ben to your point like UK has been
[[11726.0]]a counterweight in some areas uh but
[[11730.32]]okay also has like I would say they've
[[11735.16]]received a full dose of this programming
[[11740.52]]they they have that tendency yeah and
[[11744.36]]they've been in AI in particular I think
[[11747.28]]they've been on the wrong side of that
[[11751.2]]which hopefully they'll reconsider um so
[[11754.88]]so again this is one of these things
[[11757.16]]like this this is a really really
[[11759.72]]important issue and just the surface
[[11762.6]]level thing of like okay this this
[[11765.52]]technology might be able to be used for
[[11769.44]]some harmful purpose like that if that
[[11772.92]]is allowed to be the end of the
[[11775.44]]discussion like we are never going to
[[11778.0]]nothing new is ever going to happen in
[[11780.28]]the world like that that will that will
[[11782.96]]cause us ultimately to stall out
[[11786.44]]completely um and and then you know if
[[11789.96]]if we stall out that that will over time
[[11792.72]]lead to regression and and like
[[11795.68]]literally you I mean this is happening
[[11798.64]]like the power is going out like you
[[11802.8]]know German societ German German societ
[[11807.36]]German industrial companies are shutting
[[11810.28]]down because they can't afford the power
[[11813.08]]that's resulted from this this uh you
[[11816.0]]know kind of the imposition of this
[[11819.8]]policy in the energy sector um and so
[[11824.2]]this is a very very very important thing
[[11829.08]]I think the E bureaucracy has lost on
[[11833.2]]this and so I think it's going to be up
[[11836.56]]to the individual countries um to
[[11840.96]]directly confront this if they want to
[[11844.8]]um anyway so I I really applaud what
[[11847.92]]France has done and I hope more European
[[11850.88]]countries join them in in uh kind of
[[11854.36]]being on the right side on this yeah
[[11858.4]]yeah know it always is funny to me to
[[11863.96]]hear the EU and like the economists and
[[11870.04]]these kinds of things say oh the EU may
[[11874.32]]not be the leader in Innovation but
[[11878.04]]we're the leaders in regulation and I'm
[[11882.52]]like well you realize those go together
[[11886.84]]they're like one is a function of the
[[11890.8]]other okay good so and then let's do one
[[11895.8]]more Global question um lap gong Leong
[[11900.4]]asks are there any other countries that
[[11904.68]]could be receptive to techno optimism uh
[[11908.84]]for example could Britain Argentina or
[[11912.12]]Japan be ideal targets for our message
[[11915.4]]and Mission
[[11919.04]]yes uh so will you look for work on that
[[11922.04]]in
[[11925.92]]Britain and uh look we've got some
[[11930.76]]pretty good reception from the UK
[[11935.16]]government there's um you know a lot of
[[11939.92]]very very smart people there um we're
[[11945.24]]working with them you know tightly on uh
[[11950.88]]their Ai and crypto efforts and and and
[[11956.16]]we're hoping that's the case
[[11962.08]]um you know Japan
[[11968.56]]is having spent a lot of time there is
[[11974.64]]you know they've obviously shown that
[[11980.24]]capability you know over time and then
[[11984.92]]you know there's a lot about the way
[[11988.84]]Japanese Society works that that holds
[[11994.88]]them back from that at times as well um
[[12000.4]]you know without getting into all the
[[12003.76]]specifics there's you know they have a
[[12008.2]]very I would just say unusual and unique
[[12013.36]]culture um that has a great difference
[[12019.2]]for the old way of doing things um which
[[12024.0]]sometimes makes it hard to kind of
[[12027.76]]promote the new way of doing things I
[[12032.56]]also think you know around the world
[[12038.76]]World um you know the the Middle East is
[[12044.76]]very very kind of subject and and kind
[[12049.48]]of on board with techno optimism um the
[[12055.32]]UAE uh Saudi Israel of course um you
[[12060.88]]know many many countries out there are
[[12064.96]]very excited about you know the these
[[12069.56]]kinds of ideas and Tak the world forward
[[12073.92]]and like you know just creating a better
[[12077.08]]world through
[[12080.88]]technology um which I think that look
[[12085.52]]with our population growth if we don't
[[12089.64]]have a better world through technology
[[12092.72]]we're going to have a worse world
[[12096.12]]without techn I think that's like very
[[12101.76]]obvious uh so it's a it's a very
[[12106.92]]compelling message and oh by the way
[[12111.44]]South America I should say also um there
[[12115.6]]there are a lot of countries who are
[[12120.04]]really embracing techno optimism now in
[[12125.72]]South America and and that's you know
[[12130.64]]and some great new leadership there that
[[12135.16]]you know that's pushing that yeah I
[[12138.72]]would also say if you look at the
[[12142.0]]polling on this um what I think you find
[[12145.4]]is what I what you could describe as the
[[12148.52]]younger countries are more enthusiastic
[[12151.48]]about technology and I I don't mean
[[12154.08]]younger here literally of like when they
[[12157.48]]were formed but I mean two things one is
[[12160.96]]how recently they've kind of emerged
[[12163.6]]into what we would consider to be
[[12167.16]]modernity yeah um and so you know for
[[12170.92]]example to embrace you know Concepts
[[12174.16]]like democracy or free market capitalism
[[12178.68]]or you know Innovation generally um you
[[12182.76]]know global trade and so forth and then
[[12185.8]]the other is just quite simply the the
[[12189.64]]the the number of the the demographics
[[12193.36]]the the you know the the countries with
[[12197.04]]a a larger number of people and those
[[12200.72]]are often by the way the same countries
[[12203.52]]right they have a they have the reverse
[[12206.2]]demographic pyramid we have where they
[[12209.72]]actually have a lot of young people um
[[12213.4]]and young people are both you know both
[[12216.04]]young people both need Economic
[[12218.6]]Opportunity and are very fired up about
[[12222.24]]new ideas yeah by the way this is true
[[12226.28]]in Africa as well and many African
[[12231.44]]countries you know uh Nigeria Rwanda
[[12237.56]]Ghana they were their techno optimism I
[[12241.88]]think is taking hold in a real way you
[[12244.92]]know they they they need some of them
[[12249.04]]need governance improvements but um they
[[12253.68]]definitely also have young population
[[12259.0]]Saudi think 70% of the population is
[[12265.76]]under 30 so you know just to your point
[[12273.36]]um that the that very very very hopeful
[[12280.32]]in those areas uh Ben uh gtra asks do
[[12284.6]]you think the lobbying efforts by good
[[12287.6]]faith American crypto firms will be able
[[12290.36]]to move the needle politically in the
[[12293.68]]next few years um what areas make you
[[12297.24]]optimistic as it relates to American
[[12301.16]]crypto regulation crypto blockchain web
[[12308.08]]3 yeah so I think that I I I'm hopeful
[[12314.76]]I'm as hopeful as I've ever been um so
[[12318.84]]there's a there's a bunch of things that
[[12322.28]]have been really positive first of all
[[12327.04]]you know the SEC has lost I think five
[[12332.16]]cases in a row so you know like some of
[[12337.24]]their like arbitrary um enforcement of
[[12343.24]]things that aren't laws is not working
[[12349.0]]um secondly uh you know there was a bill
[[12354.4]]that passed through the house um or the
[[12359.32]]house Financial Services committee uh
[[12364.52]]which is a very I would say good bill on
[[12369.6]]crypto regulation and you know hopefully
[[12373.76]]that will eventually pass the house and
[[12380.44]]the Senate um there's
[[12389.04]]uh you know we we've seen um Wyoming I
[[12394.52]]think adopt
[[12399.76]]really good new laws around Dows um and
[[12406.92]]so there's uh some progress there um and
[[12412.24]]then you know there's been uh you know
[[12416.04]]we've been working really really hard to
[[12421.28]]educate members of Congress um and the
[[12426.52]]administration on kind of the value of
[[12431.96]]the technology uh there are strong
[[12437.68]]opponents to it you know as I mentioned
[[12442.76]]earlier and you know that's you that
[[12450.36]]continues to be worrisome um but uh but
[[12457.64]]I I think we're making great progress
[[12462.28]]and and the fair Shake pack has done a
[[12466.52]]just a tremendous job of you know kind
[[12470.92]]of backing Pro crypto candidates and
[[12474.92]]with great success there were six
[[12478.92]]different races on super Tuesday that
[[12484.6]]they backed and all six uh won so um you
[[12492.12]]know another good sign y fantastic hit a
[[12498.32]]couple other topics here quickly to get
[[12502.68]]under the wire um so Father Time asks
[[12506.12]]can you give us your thoughts on the
[[12509.12]]recent Tik Tock legislation if passed
[[12512.2]]what does this mean for big Tech going
[[12515.04]]forward and so I'll just let me give a
[[12519.36]]quick swing at that um so the Tik Tock
[[12523.84]]legislation being proposed by the US
[[12527.44]]Congress and currently being taken up in
[[12531.52]]the Senate which by the way uh and the
[[12535.08]]President Biden has already said he'll
[[12537.88]]sign it if it if it if the Senate and
[[12542.08]]the House pass it um this is legislation
[[12547.08]]that would require uh a require a
[[12551.16]]divestment of Tik Tok from its Chinese
[[12554.84]]parent company bite dance um and so Tik
[[12558.2]]Tok would have to be a purely American
[[12560.8]]company or would have to be owned by a
[[12564.24]]purely American company um and then
[[12568.12]]failing that it would be a ban of Tik
[[12572.8]]Tok um uh in in in the US um
[[12577.92]]this bill is a great example of the sort
[[12582.12]]of bipartisan dynamic in DC right now on
[[12587.04]]the topic of China which is this bill is
[[12591.76]]being enthusiastically supported by the
[[12595.44]]majority of politicians on both sides of
[[12599.16]]the aisle um I think it passed out of
[[12604.96]]its committee um like 50 to zero um
[[12610.52]]which you know is basically like it's
[[12613.8]]impossible to get anybody in DC to agree
[[12617.44]]on anything right now except basically
[[12621.52]]basically this so this is like super
[[12625.24]]bipartisan and then it's you know the
[[12627.8]]the head of that committee is a
[[12630.6]]republican uh Mike Gallagher and and you
[[12633.96]]know he immediately he worked in a
[[12636.52]]bipartisan way with his committee
[[12639.32]]members but you know the Democratic
[[12642.72]]White House immediately endorsed it bill
[[12646.48]]so so like you know this bill has like
[[12650.24]]serious momentum the Senate is taking up
[[12653.64]]right now um they're going to they're
[[12657.2]]likely to modify it in some way but it
[[12660.72]]it seems you know reasonably like
[[12663.92]]reasonably likely to pass based on what
[[12666.44]]what we can
[[12670.32]]see um you know I would say like I said
[[12675.76]]by overwhelmingly bipartisan support um
[[12679.48]]and you know look the argument for the
[[12682.8]]ban is I would say a couple different
[[12686.88]]way or not the the divestment or the ban
[[12690.88]]number one is just like you know a an
[[12695.56]]app on every on Americans on the phones
[[12699.76]]of every you know a large percent of
[[12703.04]]Americans with the surveillance and
[[12706.88]]potential propaganda kind of aspects of
[[12710.16]]that you know certainly has people in
[[12712.76]]Washington concerned and then quite
[[12715.84]]frankly there's an underlying industrial
[[12719.8]]you know dynamic which is you know the
[[12723.64]]you know the US the US internet
[[12726.6]]companies can't operate in China so
[[12729.2]]there's a you know there's there's a
[[12732.0]]sort of an unfair symmetry underneath
[[12735.48]]this that really undercuts you know I
[[12738.52]]think a lot of a lot of the a lot of the
[[12742.28]]arguments for bite dance um it has been
[[12746.92]]striking to see that uh there are
[[12750.48]]actually opponents of this Bild who have
[[12753.68]]emerged and I would describe on sort of
[[12757.0]]the further to the right and further to
[[12761.44]]the left in their respective parties um
[[12766.24]]and um you know they they you know that
[[12769.32]]those folks and I won't go through
[[12771.92]]detail but those folks make a variety a
[[12776.8]]variety of of arguments um one of the
[[12783.0]]and let mect characterize the Le the
[[12787.12]]surface level I think on the on the
[[12789.88]]further on the left I think that there
[[12793.72]]are people who think that um uh
[[12797.48]]especially kind of further left Congress
[[12800.32]]people who feel like Tik Tok is actually
[[12803.88]]a really important and vital messaging
[[12807.08]]uh system for them to be able to use
[[12809.48]]with their constituents who tend to be
[[12813.6]]younger um in very internet and so so
[[12817.48]]there's that which you know is
[[12820.44]]interesting um but then on the on the
[[12825.44]]further on the right um there is a lot
[[12830.0]]and our friend David sax for example
[[12833.48]]might be an example of this um there are
[[12837.0]]a fair number of people who are very
[[12840.76]]worried that um the US government is so
[[12845.44]]prone to abuse any regulatory capability
[[12849.72]]with respect to Tech and especially with
[[12853.4]]respect to censorship that basically if
[[12856.68]]you hand the US government any new
[[12859.76]]regulatory Authority or legal Authority
[[12863.16]]at all to come down on Tech it will
[[12866.48]]inevitably be used not just against the
[[12869.44]]Chinese company but it will also then be
[[12872.2]]used against the American companies and
[[12875.4]]so you know it's kind of it's it's there
[[12878.72]]you know some drama that's surfacing
[[12881.52]]around this and and you know we we'll
[[12884.88]]see whether the opponents can um you
[[12888.4]]know can kind of kind of pull it through
[[12891.92]]um you know look quite frankly I you
[[12896.64]]know I I you know without coming down
[[12901.12]]particularly on like I think there's
[[12903.84]]there's one of those cases where there's
[[12906.04]]actually like excellent arguments like
[[12909.32]]on all three sides like I think you
[[12913.0]]there are like very legitimate questions
[[12916.88]]here um and so um you know I think it's
[[12920.44]]great that the issue is being confronted
[[12923.44]]but I think it's also great that the you
[[12926.12]]know that the arguments have been
[[12928.08]]surfaced and that we're going to you
[[12930.16]]know hopefully figure out the right
[[12935.76]]thing to do um couple closing things um
[[12942.24]]uh close on let's see hopefully a semi-
[[12947.4]]optimistic note so um John Potter asks
[[12952.16]]how do you most effectively find common
[[12954.96]]ground with groups and interests that
[[12958.0]]you benefit from working with but with
[[12961.72]]which you are usually opposed
[[12965.92]]ideologically or otherwise I mean I
[[12972.4]]think this is uh you know there's this
[[12980.36]]term in in Washington Common Ground um
[[12986.44]]and I think that you know you always
[[12990.6]]want to start by finding the common
[[12994.4]]ground because I'll tell you something
[[12999.16]]in politics generally is most people
[[13005.8]]have the same intention um you know like
[[13011.64]]in Washington in fact you know people
[[13016.68]]want life to be fair um you know they
[[13022.44]]want they don't want people to go hungry
[[13028.12]]um they want you know citizens to be
[[13034.2]]safe but have plenty of opportunity so
[[13040.36]]like there's a lot of common ground the
[[13046.48]]the differences lie not in the intent
[[13051.44]]but how you get there like what is the
[[13054.2]]right
[[13059.52]]policy to achieve the goal and you know
[[13066.04]]so I think it's always important to
[[13070.8]]start with the goal and then kind of
[[13076.32]]work our way through you know why we
[[13082.04]]think our policy position is correct um
[[13085.72]]you know
[[13089.6]]like we don't really have a lot
[[13096.84]]of disagreements on stated intent at
[[13102.84]]least I mean I think there are some
[[13107.04]]intentions um that are that are very
[[13110.96]]difficult in Washington you know like
[[13113.88]]the
[[13117.4]]you know the the intention to kind of
[[13122.12]]control the financial system is a you
[[13126.56]]know from the government or nationalize
[[13130.2]]the banks or kind of achieve the
[[13134.92]]equivalent of nationalizing the banks is
[[13139.04]]you know when you have that intent
[[13143.08]]that's tough but like if you start with
[[13149.84]]you know most intentions are I think um
[[13156.44]]you know shared between you know us and
[[13161.48]]policy makers on both sides and then
[[13165.64]]we'll close on this great question Zach
[[13169.04]]asks would either of you ever consider
[[13173.28]]running for office and for fun what
[[13177.52]]would be your
[[13182.32]]platform um so I
[[13188.28]]want uh just because look you know I
[[13194.88]]think being a politician requires a
[[13201.76]]certain kind of skill set and attitude
[[13207.88]]and and energy from certain things that
[[13214.2]]that I I don't possess unfortunately do
[[13218.52]]you have a do you have a platform you
[[13222.32]]would run on if you did
[[13225.04]]run yeah
[[13229.76]]okay yeah let's hear your platform uh
[[13233.08]]the American
[[13237.0]]dream um so I I I won't do it now but I
[[13241.32]]like to put up this chart that shows the
[[13244.16]]change in prices in different sectors of
[[13247.08]]the economy over time and what you
[[13250.68]]basically see is the price of like
[[13255.28]]television sets and software and video
[[13259.68]]games are like crashing hard right in a
[[13263.36]]way that's like great for consumers you
[[13267.2]]know like I you I saw 75 inch flat
[[13271.08]]screen ultra high depth TVs now or down
[[13275.56]]below $500 like you know just it's great
[[13279.48]]it's amazing like when technolog is
[[13282.6]]allowed to work its magic like prices
[[13285.68]]crash in a way this just great for
[[13288.32]]consumers and it's equivalent of a giant
[[13291.52]]basically you know when prices drop it's
[[13297.12]]equivalent of a raise um um uh so makes
[[13303.24]]makes human welfare a lot better um the
[[13308.04]]three uh uh elements of the economy that
[[13312.92]]are Central to the American dream are uh
[[13317.88]]Healthcare education and housing right
[[13321.8]]and so if you think about what does it
[[13324.6]]mean to have the American dream it means
[[13327.68]]to be able to buy and own a home it
[[13330.8]]means being able to send your kids to
[[13334.4]]Great Schools get great education to
[[13338.72]]have a great life uh and then it means
[[13342.04]]you know great Healthcare to be able to
[[13344.64]]take care of yourself and your family
[[13348.8]]the prices on those are skyrocketing uh
[[13353.56]]they're just like straight to the
[[13358.16]]moon and of course those are the sectors
[[13361.64]]that are the most controlled by the
[[13365.48]]government there where there's the most
[[13369.6]]subsidies for demand from the government
[[13372.16]]there's the most restrictions on Supply
[[13375.0]]from the government and there is the
[[13378.0]]most interference with the ability to
[[13383.0]]field uh technology and and startups um
[[13388.36]]and the result is we have an entire
[[13392.88]]generation of kids um who basically I
[[13396.92]]think are quite rational and looking
[[13399.68]]forward and basically saying I'm never
[[13402.16]]going to be able to achieve the American
[[13404.16]]dream I'm never going to be able to own
[[13405.96]]a home
[[13408.04]]I'm never going to be able to get a good
[[13410.6]]education or send my kids to good
[[13412.88]]education I'm not going to be able to
[[13416.08]]get good healthare basically I'm I'm I'm
[[13419.36]]I'm not going to be able to live the
[[13421.68]]life that my parents live or my
[[13424.68]]grandparents live and I'm not going to
[[13427.24]]be a I'm not going to be able to
[[13429.48]]fundamentally form a family provide for
[[13433.4]]my kids and I think that's the I think
[[13437.4]]that's I my opinion that's the
[[13441.0]]underlying theme to kind of what has
[[13445.72]]gone wrong um sort of socially
[[13450.88]]politically um psychologically uh in the
[[13454.72]]country that's what's led to the sort of
[[13457.56]]intense level of pessimism That's What's
[[13460.92]]led to sort of this attraction you know
[[13465.08]]kind of very zero some uh politics to uh
[[13469.24]]you know recrimination over over over
[[13474.0]]optimism and building um and so I I
[[13478.52]]would I would I would I would confront
[[13482.24]]that absolutely directly um and then of
[[13485.6]]course I would point out that I I don't
[[13488.16]]think anybody in Washington is doing
[[13490.6]]that right now
[[13494.76]]so either either I would either I would
[[13499.2]]win because I'm the only one saying it
[[13501.96]]out loud or I would lose because nobody
[[13505.68]]cares but I I think it would uh I've
[[13509.36]]always wondered whether that actually
[[13512.44]]would would whether both on the
[[13516.2]]substance and the and on the message
[[13520.12]]whether that would be a uh the right
[[13524.64]]platform yeah no it would certainly be
[[13529.84]]the thing to do as the thing it's very
[[13535.72]]complex in that um you know Health Care
[[13542.76]]policy is largely National but education
[[13549.28]]policy and housing policy has also got a
[[13554.6]]very large local component so it' be a
[[13559.4]]compli kind of complicated set of
[[13564.36]]policies that you'd have to enforce you
[[13568.32]]uh we still have a ton of questions so
[[13570.92]]we may do part two on this at some point
[[13573.8]]but we really appreciate your time and
[[13577.84]]attention and we will see you soon okay
[[13581.88]]thank
[[13585.47]]you
