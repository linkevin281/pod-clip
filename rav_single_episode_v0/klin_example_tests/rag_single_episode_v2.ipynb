       " Document(page_content=\"Well, no. So it was a, it was, this was considered research, not development. And so the, the, the, the way that it was, it was like an internal scientific unit at a company. And so they actually published it as a paper. I see. And, and they're actually, there's a long history of this where this is actually a lot of the great breakthroughs over time have actually come out of like industrial research labs like this. And then they, and then the company that develops, it publishes it and then they don't realize until later that they should have kept it secret. But, but also the reason that they were able to hire all these great researchers out of all these universities is they promised them that they could publish their work, right? And so sort of part of the deal with these guys was that they would get to publish. So they, they had this key breaker in 2017. So, but, but it sort of became clear in the 20 tens that like there was finally progress being made and some of these systems were gonna start to work. And Elon had some conversation with \\nLarry Page\\n who was running \\nGoogle\\n at the time. And Larry said to Elon, you know, this A I thing is really gonna work and we're gonna end up with a is that are like, you know, much, you know, smarter and more powerful than people. And Elon said, well, aren't you worried that they're gonna like, have their own goals and they're gonna take over and they're not gonna want to surround anymore. And Larry's, Larry's response was you're being species, you're being racist, but towards your species. And if they're a better form of life, then they should take over and we should all die and humanity should go away. Now knowing Larry, I think there's at least a 50% chance he was joking, but Elon couldn't tell and took him seriously. And so Elon had a visceral reaction and was like, oh my God, like the big risk here is not just developing A I, the big risk here is \\nGoogle\\n develops A I and \\nLarry Page\\n is in control of it. And he does horrible, horrible things. And so he started, he's like, oh, so he called all these people who he knew. And he said we need to start the competitive effort to that today and we need to call it, I mean, it needs to be as opposed to \\nGoogle\\n's closed A I, it needs to be open A I and, and this was to protect the world is to protect the world in Elon's views, to protect the world. So, what Elon says is we need to go hire all the best researchers we can. Speaker 3\\n02:29:34\\nIt seems to be, that's what he's always done. It's like \\nTesla\\n was, cars need to be electric. Space X\\n was, if anything happens to the earth, we could live on \\nMars\\n, he's always motivated by saving the planet. Speaker 2\\n02:29:48\\nThat's right. And, and, and, and humanity. Right. Exactly. And humanity. Yeah.\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Basically in there. And so these people in the 19 thirties knew that there was this difference. And so they said, should we model these things after a calculating machine in which they are hyper literal, like you say almost autistic, right? Which is like they're just like it was like Savant like machines where they're like really good at running large numbers of mathematical calculations very fast and then we'll give people, the ability to write programs based on that, but they're never going to be good at patterns. They're never gonna be good at language. They're never gonna be good at, they're never gonna know what anything means. You know, they, they're always going to be hard to talk to. You're never gonna be able to use natural language interface. You know, they're never gonna be able to know the difference between, you know, the, the difference between a cat and a cinnamon roll and a photo. Like they're just not gonna be good at that. So they'll be like hyper literal in that way, it's super fast but hyper literal and then humans will just still be completely different or should we try to build computers that are modeled after the human brain? And, and so it actually turns out the, the first paper on the concept of the neural network, which is the architecture of Cha A GP T it was actually written in 1943. And the A I systems we use today are still based on the ideas in that paper. So it is 80 years ago, right? So they knew enough about neuron structures and synapses in the brain that they knew. They were 43 1943. No, but, but they knew and by the way, look, the field of A I started in like 1943 like that actually fired the starting gun. And actually people have worked for the last 80 years trying to get neural networks to work and they finally just started to work. But my point is like, they, they knew from the very beginning there were these two totally different ways of making computers and they knew what the trade offs were and they just were. But it just turned out that historically, they were able to make the one kind of computer for the last 80 years. And that created the computer as we know it today. And then it turns out there's this completely other way to make a computer and that's based on the, it, it's inspired by, it's not the same as the brain, but it's inspired by the structure of the brain. And as a consequence, it's a new kind of computer and a way to think about it is, it's a computer that's actually an A I computer is actually very bad at all. The hyper literal stuff, right? And so, for example, J GP T has this thing called Hallucinates. And so if you ask it a question and it knows the answer, it gives you the answer. If it doesn't know the answer, it just makes one up. Speaker 3\\n02:18:31\\nSo it's more creative and less accurate. Exactly. Speaker 2\\n02:18:34\\nSome, somebody once said that somebody said that one of the guys who studies this says A I is not like a computer, it's like a pretty good person. It's not like the best person, but it's like a pretty good person. And what do we know about? Pretty good people? They're right. A lot of the time but a lot of the time they're not. And can you always tell the difference? Not necessarily, you know? Do they sound as confident when they're wrong as when they're right? Yeah. Do they know? No, they don't if you ask. Speaker 3\\n02:18:56\\nIt sounds like a real issue if we've spent 80 years establishing the fact that what you're getting back from a computer is more like a results from the results from a calculator. But now we're getting these fuzzy results that are more like mediocre human results, even though we've had 80 years of what we think of as accurate, that could create confusion. Speaker 2\\n02:19:23\\nSo there was a court case about three months ago where a lawyer had Chet GP T write a legal argument to be presented to a judge in a court and it did it and it hallucinated several court cases precedents that don't exist and the judge caught, it just made them up, made him up and they sound great. By the way, they sound exactly like court cases. The whole thing hangs together logically. It's just literally not true. It's mentioned cases that didn't happen. And so, and it turns out if you submit false made up court cases in court, you get disbarred as a lawyer, like you're done being a lawyer. And so the judge basically like came very close to disbarring the lawyer on the spot and the lawyer is basically a lawyer. The judge is like, did you use judge EPT to do this? And the lawyer basically fessed up and the judge basically said, if you ever do this again, I'm going to disbar you and destroy your career. But it's exactly for that reason. But however, hallucination, creativity. Speaker 3\\n02:20:09\\nBe a great scene in a movie. For example, we find in a movie. Speaker 2\\n02:20:13\\nWell, so and it actually turns out so there, there are companies now building A I for lawyers and, and actually we, we, so we did a bunch of work, we haven't invested yet, but we've done, we've done a bunch of work in this space because one of the things that A I can do is it can like write, you can write legal briefs and if it doesn't hallucinate, they're actually really good legal briefs. And so we, we've been talking to like professional lawyers about this and what the, what the professional lawyers will tell you actually is, you actually don't just want accuracy. When you're thinking about writing legal briefs, you actually do want creativity because there are different ways to make legal arguments. And maybe the way that you've thought of on your own is not the best way to do it. And maybe if you had a copilot, right? Think of you're writing a legal brief, you're a lawyer, you have a legal, you're writing a legal brief, you have a copilot. Right. And, and that copilot is just giving you ideas, right? And some of the ideas are going to be great idea. Some of the ideas are gonna be terrible ideas, but they're all new ideas, the ideas where you don't have to sit and come up with them on your own. Right? And so what the lawyers are saying basically is like in that case, you actually, you actually, you want some hallucinating, right? You, you, you don't want make up a court case that didn't happen but you want, oh, here's a different way to make the same argument, right? Or, or you might also view it as like if you're writing a closing argument to be presented to a jury like that, you know, as you know, it's like a storytelling exercise. And so you might want actually, you know, some brainstorming, you don't want the thing to do it for you because you're the guy who has to stand up there and actually present it and you have to really be willing to stand behind it, but it might be helpful to have a writing partner that can actually help you do that. And so there, there's this sort of double edged, like the fact that it Hallucinates is both a big problem, but it's also magical because we've never had computers that make things up before. Like that's a brand new thing. If you had told me three years ago, we're gonna have computers that like make up like it's never, it's never happened. There's never been a way to do that. It's the same thing and now you're seeing it, it's the way to see this really clearly. Of course, is visual design, visual art, you know, coming out of like mid journey or da or these things where it will make up all of these crazy art things and you know, look half the time it will make up like it will. And you know, there's this famous thing, they've figured it out now. But for a long time, the way that you could tell that computer art was being made by algorithm was it just, it would give extra fingers, it just turned out that the training data it was trained on. It just like it just turns out like human, human bodies relatively straightforward, except that there are these like detailed finger appendages. And if you are looking at a billion photos or pictures of people, they have fingers in all kinds of different positions. And so the early versions of the A I basically just didn't know how to do fingers accurately. They fix that now, right where it no longer does that. But by the way, if you want it to, it still will, right? And so if you tell it, render me a scene where everybody has seven fingers, it will happily do it for you. And computers never used to be able to do that, right? Or if you just want to tell it to use it, one of the things you can do, it is really fun with these things is you can do it. You can say like use your imagination or, or you can say another thing you can do is you can say, so there's this thing called prompt engineering. So it's how do you write out the prompt that tells the A I what to do, right? So which is true for both a text A I and for an image A I do the prompt. And it turns out there was a research thing done by \\nGoogle\\n a few, a few months back about what's the optimal prompt that, that optimizes the chance that there won't be hallucinations that it's gonna be the most likely to be what's called factually grounded. And it turned out the opal prompt starts with, take a deep breath really gives you the best results, right? And, and, and so, and, and, and this gets to the, the, the amazingness of what's happening.\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Speaker 2\\n48:07\\nYeah, look. So, so, and I would say \\nGoogle\\n if it was in this interesting position where number one, they invented a lot of these A I technologies, right? And so the key breakthrough for Chet GP T actually happened at \\nGoogle\\n in 2017 in classic the company form, they sat on it. They didn't, they didn't use it. If you talk to people in \\nGoogle\\n, they will tell you that \\nGoogle\\n could have had GP T chat, GP T for the way you have it today, they could have had it in 2019. Had they say, have they been focused on it?\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",

Or, you know, you could say like, I have here, I have this code that's gonna render something I need it to be faster. How should I, how should I make, how should I perform as optimize it? And a will say, well, you know, here's how you do it and here's how I, here's how I, the A I would rewrite it. And so, or you can tell the A I to like make changes, right? And so it's like, I want, you know, everything to be, I don't know, it's like you're you wanna do a translation from \\nEnglish\\n to \\nSpanish\\n and you can use the A I to like, find all the places where you have an \\nEnglish\\n language word and you can swap into the \\nSpanish\\n translation and A I could do that for you. And so it's like, it's called pilot. It's like a super, it's like a super assistant kind of thing. And so that's the, that's like a radical change. And so the, the coders that are using that versus not using that today, they're pretty much universally kind of saying that's a night and day kind of thing. And then that's just with today's A I and what everybody expects is the A is in the future are gonna get much more sophisticated. And so the, the, the sort of what the A I people basically say is in five years or 10 years, you're not even gonna have that, what you're instead gonna have is like the equivalent of like 1000 A I programmers working for you. And so you're not even gonna be writing code yourself. You're just gonna be like, basically managing the A is to write the code and, and you can basically say, you know, we would go off and do all this design and just coding and graphics and like whatever it is and you, you basically hand out assignments and then the A is go off and do it and they report back and then you kind of oversee the entire process. And so if, if that vision plays out, that's a complete revolution, right? That and that, and then the way to think about that is to think about this in terms of productivity, you know, how much software functionality can one person make in an hour or a day or a year? And what all of these changes mean is sort of an explosion of productivity. You just get to make a lot more code. Speaker 3\\n02:12:22\\nIf A I learns to code that really changes things.

Well, that's why I said, even neural networks, like, as I said, the, the, the, the first A I, I was actually shocked to learn this. I was reconstructing the history of A I last year. And I didn't even, I, I thought the debate started in the forties. It actually started in the thirties about whether you could build computers based on the human brain. So in the 19, like, how much do they know about the brain in the 19 thirties? Like, it couldn't have been that much, but they knew enough to, to, I immediately think like, wow, here's, here's what we could do. And so like, you know, like to me, like, those are the people I really to be that far ahead of your time and write. It's just like, wow, amazing. Speaker 3\\n03:10:52\\nHow would you, you know, how does Moore's Law continue to work? Speaker 2\\n03:10:58\\nSo the, you never get to the end. No, you get to the end. Well, you, you, there's huge debate around this. You, you're, you're down to what's called two nanometer transistors. And so we're, we're down to the, the level of manufacturing that's taking place. The, the incredible leaps if, if you ever get a chance, there's this company I think called Applied Materials. That's the \\nDutch\\n company that makes the equipment to manufacture modern microchips. And it's these giant rooms, it's, it's just incredibly elaborate machinery and is doing all these things a lot of us with the photolithography. So it's literally shining patterns with light to manufacture, you know, things that end up being material. And then it's these manufacturing processes, two nano two nanometers, you know, fractions of it, you know, tiny, tiny, tiny fractions of a human hair stuff as like the atomic level, like a lot of the barriers for progress. And Moore's Law literally is getting down to the level of individual atoms. And the problem is like, we can't set by the atoms without blowing everything up. It unbelievable. And so yeah, it's like manufacturing the atomic level, you know, there's huge amounts of engineering going into trying to optimize that. There's a lot of work going into trying to make like ships three dimensional right. So you, so it's not taking up another dimension, what else? There's, you know, a lot of work going into so called quantum computers, right, which is a totally different architecture design, which in theory is gonna be, you know, another one of these huge breakthroughs that just works totally differently. By the way, there's a lot of work going into biological computers. So there's people working on light storage, like turns out you can store huge amounts of data in DNA because the human body encodes enormous amounts of information that is really cool cellular level. And so there's, there's people working on that. There's people working on biological computers, you know, growing computers and tanks.

But if you, if you care about the mission of having it be open, then come and work with me and he, and he called it Open A I and he made it a nonprofit, not a for profit. And he said, you know, and then he said, basically, he said, everything we do at open A I is gonna be open sourced in the same way. Right. So he said, basically, if you come here, your work is all gonna get published, everything's gonna be open. He, he even said early on, he said, the mission of open A I is to make sure that A I is, is is it happens and is safe and is universally available all of humanity. And he said it would actually be fine if somebody else does that and makes it available. In which case open A I will just shut down and be our mission will be complete. So it was set up as nonprofit, is registered as nonprofit. He donated it what's reported to be something like $50 million to get it off the ground.

But in, in the beginning, it was like 2014 or 2015, they didn't have the transformer yet. So they didn't know how to make, like Je GP D work. They were primarily working on trying to have a, is that can play video video games in those days as sort of a proxy for being able to make decisions and so forth.

Like \\nGoogle\\n or \\nMicrosoft\\n, and then it won't open open A, I won't win. And so he turned a, he turned what had been a pure nonprofit into a nonprofit that owns a for profit. The employees of the nonprofit became employees of the for profit salaries went up a lot, the amount of money that they raised, went up a lot. Their, their, their ability to invest went up a lot. Speaker 3\\n02:33:29\\nWhat was Elon's participation for the original 50 million? Speaker 2\\n02:33:33\\nSo Elon has said publicly that he had nothing for it. What he says is he, it was a philanthropic donation. You're under tax laws, you can't just turn a for profit. You can't just turn in a profit into a for profit because it's a violation of tax laws. And so, II, I think legally they probably couldn't give him anything. But anyway, he says he, he says he got nothing for it. And he, he has said in public basically, he's like, wow, that seems like a new trick. Why, why doesn't everybody do it? And so he's, he has suggested over the, over the years that like there was something wrong with how they did this and you know, who knows? We'll see. But Sam made that change and, and by the way that worked, right, they were able to, they were able to all of a sudden start paying competitive salaries to \\nGoogle\\n for engineers. They were able to buy all the computer power they needed, they were able to buy, they have you know, they have lots of money going into making training data. And so like that, that part of it worked and that's what resulted in Chet GP T that's why Chet GP T exists and that's why Dolly exists. He did another thing along the way, which was he, he, he turned it basically into closed A I, so he, he, he, he, he turned it into a for profit and he canceled the part where it publishes everything and basically as of four years ago or five years ago or so, they stopped publishing their research and he did that under the theory that it is too dangerous to distribute. It's too, it's too powerful, too dangerous and other people can't, can't have it.

That it's just kind of, you know, you know, many hundreds of thousands of very smart engineers have been 20 years, you know, and big huge industries have been built trying to get this stuff to work.

Speaker 2\\n02:53:44\\nQuite a bit, quite a lot. Yeah, it's, it's an amazing. It's, I mean, you know, I for me, it's almost entirely long form, you know, it's, it's discussions, podcasts, even audio books, but it's just like the repository of information knowledge on \\nYouTube\\n. It's just, yeah, incredibly staggering. And then actually a lot of music, I do a lot of music listening on \\nYouTube\\n now. Speaker 3\\n02:54:01\\nHas it replaced other forms of visual media. Speaker 1\\n02:54:06\\nYeah, I think so. Yeah. Speaker 3\\n02:54:07\\nLess television, less movies, more \\nYouTube\\n. Speaker 2\\n02:54:10\\nWell, no, I don't watch, so I don't watch my, so my eight year old watches \\nYouTube\\n and preference in television movies. I don't do that if I'm watching television or movie, I want a very specific experience. It's usually with friends or at the end of the day and I want to watch, you know, whatever is the best new movie or whatever. So I'm not like, I, I'm, I just don't have the mode of like sitting and watching \\nYouTube\\n videos or TikTok videos the way a lot of people do. And it's just frankly, the life of time, I'm sure it would be very fun. But for me, it's basic, it's actually mostly actually for \\nYouTube\\n is audio content, mostly for me, it's an audio source. So I, I'm, I'm an audiobook podcast, spoken word guy, you know, like two hours a day, you know, driving around and running around and doing everything, getting ready in the morning. And so it's usually either I'm listening to a \\nYouTube\\n slash podcast or an audiobook. But you but \\nYouTube\\n has been taking a bigger and bigger share of that. Speaker 3\\n02:54:53\\nWhat was the piece you recently the optimist, what. Speaker 2\\n02:54:57\\nWas it called? The techno optimist manifesto, techno optimist manifesto. Speaker 3\\n02:55:02\\nPlease explain it to me. Yes. Speaker 2\\n02:55:04\\nIt's both radical and not radical at all. So this is my history. Obsession comes in So it's very radical and that it just, it says these things that we have very radical, which is technology is overwhelmingly net good. Capitalism is overwhelmingly net good. And basically the more technology and the more capitalism we get, the better things we're going to get. And I describe sort of in detail why that's the case. I describe in detail what the arguments are against that and why I think that they're wrong. I also described by the way, the limits to that position. The things that I'm also not claiming, but it's basically, you know, it's a call to arms for the kinds of people who build new products, build new technologies, build new companies. You know, I describe right up front in the piece that basically, I think we have all been on the receiving end of a demoralization campaign for the last 15 years to basically convince us that all these things are bad and evil. And I think it's basically, you know, people, it's a demoralization campaign is being run by people who are very threatened by change and people who are very resentful and bitter and we should not let them demoralize us into not making things better. And so, yeah, I, I really kind of went to town. I was inspired by a lot of prior manifestos. One in particular that I enjoyed tremendously, which is the futurist manifesto from the Italian futurist art movement. And the like around 1910. So I, I don't know that I, I don't know that I, I hit the bar of the futurist manifesto but that was kind of my, that was my sort of inspirational kind of starting point. And of course, that was an artistic aesthetic movement, not a technological movement, but it was at a time when they were very obsessed with new technologies and what new technologies would mean for art. So I hopefully I got a little bit of that flavor in there. Speaker 3\\n02:56:31\\nWhen is technology in that negative? Yeah. Speaker 2\\n02:56:34\\nSo, so when it kills a lot of people, when it, you know, basically when it causes misery, right? So, you know, look, fire, you know, I talk in the manifesto like all of our both optimism and fear of technologies is embedded in the myth of \\nPrometheus\\n who is the God that brought fire down from the mountain man. Fire is the life giver. Fire is the source of light and heat and cooks food and serves as, you know, warmth at night and scares off the wolves. And it allows us to mount, you know, defense fire is also a means of attack and you can use fire to burn somebody to death. You can burn down an entire city, you can fire flaming arrows. I've been reading about the history of in the middle of \\nMiddle East\\n stuff and they they, one of the reasons that they discovered there was oil in \\nthe Middle East\\n is because they were, the, the, the \\nArabs\\n of that region were early adopters of Napalm. In the mid 18 hundreds, they discovered a way to basically take petro, you know, chemical petrochemical substances and, and basically make, you know, essentially early Napalm with them. So like a lot of people died by fire and I mean, look like what is ammunition, you know, what's you know, we read about shelling, taking place somewhere, you know, that's bomb, they're setting up bombs, fire is the weapon of a bomb. Fire is the weapon of you know, the catalyst for a bullet. Fire. It's a huge power source is, you know, what does a nuclear weapon do? Is it generates fire, right? And so it, it's, it's like it's all in there, you know, but, but the thing is like you can say that basically, like it's really easy. The same thing, like I'm drinking water, you can drown in water. You know, you can use a shovel to dig a, well, you can use a shovel to close to death. It's a tool and I won't go so far as to say, tools are value neutral in that, you know, they carry consequences with them and specifically, they carry consequences to the ordering of human society, which is ultimately the thing that's being litigated when we talk about all this stuff. But that said they tend to have both you use cases and it is, you know, it is arguably easy to get carried away and just assume that it's only the upsides and I think it's also very easy to get carried away and to say that it's mostly downsides. I think most arguments about technology are not actually arguments about technology. I think the arguments about the ordering of society, I think most people opposed to technological change are not actually opposed to the technology per se. They're opposed to what they see as a diminishment of their own status and power. I think that's why the, you know, the news industry is so anti tech is because they view it as a challenge to their own, you know, their traditional gatekeeping role and their, and their historical businesses, you know, look is societal change, good or bad, you know, it depends, right. You know, we, we, we are all very happy, we don't live in the society order the way that they were 4000 years ago.\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Right. And, and, and what is that? Something else? It, it, to your point, it's the composite of all of human experience. But also it's not, this is very important. There's no, there's no, it in the way that we think about it, there's no person, there's no, there's no little person in there. There's no, there's no, I understand, right? It's not there. So there's no point of view. Another way of thinking about it, what it's doing is it's generating \\nNetflix\\n scripts, it's generating \\nNetflix\\n, it's generating machine. All it wants to do is tell you a story that you're gonna like. Speaker 3\\n02:45:03\\nTell me the different categories of software between the internet and my eyes, everything. What are all of those things that happen? What are all the different processes that happen software wise like using \\nNetscape\\n as an example of one of the pieces, but it's not all the pieces. So what does, what, what are all the pieces you need? Speaker 2\\n02:45:27\\nSo somewhere there's a piece of so say there's a piece of content you're looking at a web page that content is stored in a storage system somewhere. So stored in hard drive somewhere that's stored that is managed by a computer called a server that could be a, literally a computer sitting in a closet somewhere or it could be on, on in a cloud which is basically just a giant collection of computers kind of run, run as a big grid. And then there's, there's the hardware server computer and storage and then there's this, it's called server software. So there's the software that gets the request for the content and then responses with a request there, the. Speaker 3\\n02:45:60\\nSoftware would be built into that system. No, it's not a, it's not an added on piece. Speaker 2\\n02:46:04\\nYeah, it's, it's there server software. It's called a web servers piece of software which would run on a server computer. So, so the server, so usually the terminology we use is client server. So client is like what the user uses and the server is like what's running in the background somewhere. And so when I say server, that both means that can mean both the hardware itself of a computer in a closet somewhere. Or it can mean a piece of software running on that computer that does server like functions that tells it how to be a server basically. So their server software running up in the cloud that's. Speaker 3\\n02:46:33\\nAlways connected to the server. So it wouldn't be a general one that you would talk to other servers. It would only talk to that server, the software. Speaker 2\\n02:46:41\\nSo the simplest case is just a single computer, a single server computer with a single piece of server software on it. Now, in practice, most of what you have today is much more complicated than that. The systems have evolved to become a lot more powerful. And so probably what's actually happening. Like if you're looking at a web page today is probably you're accessing the server is a cloud of like a million computers and you're just hitting randomly one of those computers versus another one and there's a network switch that's balancing across the million other people that are trying to access the same content at the same time. So it's, it's become a very elaborate, you know, plate spinning exercise on the back end. And there's these giant businesses like \\nAmazon\\n web services that that, that manage all that, but it's still the same, what do you experience is still the same thing as far as you're concerned. It's just a server, it's just giving you content. There's probably two really critical Other things that happened back there, one is, there's a lot of work that goes into making this fast. And so there's, there's this process called caching. And so like there's probably another server that is actually closer to you that's like at the telecom company that use your wire wireless provider that has like a copy of that content already on it so that it doesn't have to actually go all the way up. And so there's this, it's called caching systems, performance systems. And then there's all these security systems, you know, the servers can get attacked, right. There's lots of hackers that want to like break in or disable these systems. And so these days, they have all these defense mechanisms to be able to fend off cyberattacks. Speaker 3\\n02:48:00\\nWhat would they want? What would a hacker want to get into it for? Speaker 2\\n02:48:03\\nSo a couple of things, one is to get a lot of it is to try to get the user data. So to try to get your name and password and credit card number or theft or they might want to maliciously change the content deface it, you know, graffiti artist, it's digitally or they might just want to destroy, they might want to actually take that that server offline, they might not want it to exist anymore. And what, what they do and they don't want it to exist anymore is the bad guys will do what's called a denial of service attack, which is Ad Os or D OS attack. And basically that means that the bad, the bad guys basically set up, you know, a large number of hostile computers to just barrage the server with like too many requests and cause it to basically melt down. And so there's all these elaborate systems by the way, the Chinese government does this. So the the the Chinese government has the, we know that we know that because it's not been well documented. So one of our companies was the first company that experienced this. So the Chinese have what's called the Great firewall which prevents their, their citizens from looking outside. The Great firewall consists of millions of computers that are being used for censorship and filtering. They have a capability to turn the Great firewall into something we call the Great Cannon. And so they can turn it into an outward bound attack and it's so big and so powerful that it can overwhelm any sort of small internet company. And even for the big internet companies, this could be hard to fight off. And so there's actually these pitched, there's almost these pitched digital wars that take place where the Chinese or other happening all the time or it's on occasion. Well, the Chinese aren't always doing it but there's, there's always denial of service attacks. Somebody is always trying to do it. So it's, it's actually not that expensive to run a denial of service attack. You might even just do it for commercial competition reason. You know, it's Christmas, you're competing with somebody if you're nefarious, right? What you would do is you would basically mount to denial of service attack against your competitors website so that they couldn't sell anything. Right. And I, I'm sure that's happened too, right? And then there are these things called botnets. And so one of the things that computer viruses do is if your, if your computer gets a virus. It gets basically recruited into a botnet and your computer ends up getting used to do these attacks or by the way, your toaster or your fridge. Right. So there, there's this, like, yeah, so there's this, like, there's this digital war that's kind of constantly taking place constant. Oh, North North Korea does a lot of hacking. They do a lot of hacking for financial reasons. They, they fund a lot of the, their military through, hacking for financial crimes and then they, they hire, third party, hacker rings on the internet to, to do it for them. And so, and then there's now, and then by the way, there's also like mass propaganda efforts. And so a lot of nation \\nStates\\n now have what they call covert influence teams where they're, you know, and then that form of the attack is to upload lots of fake content, right? And to try to overwhelm the, you know, the real content or, or, or whatever, you know, whatever, right. Like create lots of fake accounts. So there, there, whenever you are these days, whenever you are doing that, your computer is kind of maneuvering very elegantly through this kind of digital firestorm that's happening all the time. And so you generally never notice it but it is actually happening. But the, the amount of brain power and computer hardware that has been spent over the last 20 years trying to get these systems to be good at repelling all these attacks is actually quite, quite staggering. It's like this, this whole para parallel kind of Cyber Cyber War taking place. And of course, this is just the very beginning. Like these, these wars are gonna get like much more intense in the years ahead. We, we haven't yet had like a full, basically like military war that's been accompanied by a cyber war. But like what, you know, what everybody's worried about is like, OK, like it for somebody in \\nRussia\\n where decide to invade \\nGermany\\n, for example, with the first thing they do is take down the \\nGerman\\n power grid, you know, I don't know, maybe, right? And so you know, or, or, or basically, or, you know, maybe hack into all the self driving cars and cause them to all drive off the road or crash into each other, right? And so there, there's real world consequences more and more to, you know, to, to all these things. So anyway, so that's what's happening on the outside. And then basically, you've got your, you know, Wi Fi or whatever here or your cell connection and then you've got your computer and then your, your computer corresponding with your \\niphone\\n or your \\nMac\\n has, you know, many layers of software to basically deal with all that. Download the content, render the content for you, you know, that takes place in the web browser, you know, usually or the operating system somewhere then present it to you in a good way and then let you interact with it. And so that, that that's what's called the client. Speaker 3\\n02:52:03\\nAll there is, is the browser on your side or is there more than a browser? Speaker 2\\n02:52:08\\nYeah. Well, the browsers have gotten very complicated, right? So correspondingly the browsers are also not very sophisticated. And so for example, your brow, I'll give you an example, your browser has all sorts of security countermeasures in it also itself. And so if you download a piece of content that's been compromised and has like a malicious worm or virus inside it, your browser and your operating system have ways of detecting that and, and, and, and, and preventing you know that from infecting your system. So it's got that it's got all kinds of things in there for performance, making everything fast. It's got, you know, things in there for dealing with video and music on the. Speaker 3\\n02:52:37\\nSimplest level, forgetting the war aspects of it, even though those are real world concerns, the actual connection is pretty simple. It's a server talking to a browser right over the internet. Speaker 2\\n02:52:51\\nAnd you can still do exactly that like you, you, you can still run it exactly that way that still works in, in practice, nobody does that anymore because it's all gotten much more sophisticated behind the scenes, but not in a way that you would ever notice if all of the other complicated stuff is doing its job.

       " Document(page_content=\"Well, no. So it was a, it was, this was considered research, not development. And so the, the, the, the way that it was, it was like an internal scientific unit at a company. And so they actually published it as a paper. I see. And, and they're actually, there's a long history of this where this is actually a lot of the great breakthroughs over time have actually come out of like industrial research labs like this. And then they, and then the company that develops, it publishes it and then they don't realize until later that they should have kept it secret. But, but also the reason that they were able to hire all these great researchers out of all these universities is they promised them that they could publish their work, right? And so sort of part of the deal with these guys was that they would get to publish. So they, they had this key breaker in 2017. So, but, but it sort of became clear in the 20 tens that like there was finally progress being made and some of these systems were gonna start to work. And Elon had some conversation with \\nLarry Page\\n who was running \\nGoogle\\n at the time. And Larry said to Elon, you know, this A I thing is really gonna work and we're gonna end up with a is that are like, you know, much, you know, smarter and more powerful than people. And Elon said, well, aren't you worried that they're gonna like, have their own goals and they're gonna take over and they're not gonna want to surround anymore. And Larry's, Larry's response was you're being species, you're being racist, but towards your species. And if they're a better form of life, then they should take over and we should all die and humanity should go away. Now knowing Larry, I think there's at least a 50% chance he was joking, but Elon couldn't tell and took him seriously. And so Elon had a visceral reaction and was like, oh my God, like the big risk here is not just developing A I, the big risk here is \\nGoogle\\n develops A I and \\nLarry Page\\n is in control of it. And he does horrible, horrible things. And so he started, he's like, oh, so he called all these people who he knew. And he said we need to start the competitive effort to that today and we need to call it, I mean, it needs to be as opposed to \\nGoogle\\n's closed A I, it needs to be open A I and, and this was to protect the world is to protect the world in Elon's views, to protect the world. So, what Elon says is we need to go hire all the best researchers we can. Speaker 3\\n02:29:34\\nIt seems to be, that's what he's always done. It's like \\nTesla\\n was, cars need to be electric. Space X\\n was, if anything happens to the earth, we could live on \\nMars\\n, he's always motivated by saving the planet. Speaker 2\\n02:29:48\\nThat's right. And, and, and, and humanity. Right.

       " Document(page_content=\"Basically in there. And so these people in the 19 thirties knew that there was this difference. And so they said, should we model these things after a calculating machine in which they are hyper literal, like you say almost autistic, right? Which is like they're just like it was like Savant like machines where they're like really good at running large numbers of mathematical calculations very fast and then we'll give people, the ability to write programs based on that, but they're never going to be good at patterns. They're never gonna be good at language. They're never gonna be good at, they're never gonna know what anything means. You know, they, they're always going to be hard to talk to. You're never gonna be able to use natural language interface. You know, they're never gonna be able to know the difference between, you know, the, the difference between a cat and a cinnamon roll and a photo. Like they're just not gonna be good at that. So they'll be like hyper literal in that way, it's super fast but hyper literal and then humans will just still be completely different or should we try to build computers that are modeled after the human brain? And, and so it actually turns out the, the first paper on the concept of the neural network, which is the architecture of Cha A GP T it was actually written in 1943. And the A I systems we use today are still based on the ideas in that paper. So it is 80 years ago, right? So they knew enough about neuron structures and synapses in the brain that they knew. They were 43 1943. No, but, but they knew and by the way, look, the field of A I started in like 1943 like that actually fired the starting gun. And actually people have worked for the last 80 years trying to get neural networks to work and they finally just started to work. But my point is like, they, they knew from the very beginning there were these two totally different ways of making computers and they knew what the trade offs were and they just were. But it just turned out that historically, they were able to make the one kind of computer for the last 80 years. And that created the computer as we know it today. And then it turns out there's this completely other way to make a computer and that's based on the, it, it's inspired by, it's not the same as the brain, but it's inspired by the structure of the brain. And as a consequence, it's a new kind of computer and a way to think about it is, it's a computer that's actually an A I computer is actually very bad at all. The hyper literal stuff, right? And so, for example, J GP T has this thing called Hallucinates. And so if you ask it a question and it knows the answer, it gives you the answer. If it doesn't know the answer, it just makes one up. Speaker 3\\n02:18:31\\nSo it's more creative and less accurate. Exactly. Speaker 2\\n02:18:34\\nSome, somebody once said that somebody said that one of the guys who studies this says A I is not like a computer, it's like a pretty good person. It's not like the best person, but it's like a pretty good person. And what do we know about? Pretty good people? They're right. A lot of the time but a lot of the time they're not. And can you always tell the difference? Not necessarily, you know? Do they sound as confident when they're wrong as when they're right? Yeah. Do they know? No, they don't if you ask. Speaker 3\\n02:18:56\\nIt sounds like a real issue if we've spent 80 years establishing the fact that what you're getting back from a computer is more like a results from the results from a calculator. But now we're getting these fuzzy results that are more like mediocre human results, even though we've had 80 years of what we think of as accurate, that could create confusion. Speaker 2\\n02:19:23\\nSo there was a court case about three months ago where a lawyer had Chet GP T write a legal argument to be presented to a judge in a court and it did it and it hallucinated several court cases precedents that don't exist and the judge caught, it just made them up, made him up and they sound great. By the way, they sound exactly like court cases. The whole thing hangs together logically. It's just literally not true. It's mentioned cases that didn't happen. And so, and it turns out if you submit false made up court cases in court, you get disbarred as a lawyer, like you're done being a lawyer. And so the judge basically like came very close to disbarring the lawyer on the spot and the lawyer is basically a lawyer. The judge is like, did you use judge EPT to do this? And the lawyer basically fessed up and the judge basically said, if you ever do this again, I'm going to disbar you and destroy your career. But it's exactly for that reason. But however, hallucination, creativity. Speaker 3\\n02:20:09\\nBe a great scene in a movie. For example, we find in a movie. Speaker 2\\n02:20:13\\nWell, so and it actually turns out so there, there are companies now building A I for lawyers and, and actually we, we, so we did a bunch of work, we haven't invested yet, but we've done, we've done a bunch of work in this space because one of the things that A I can do is it can like write, you can write legal briefs and if it doesn't hallucinate, they're actually really good legal briefs. And so we, we've been talking to like professional lawyers about this and what the, what the professional lawyers will tell you actually is, you actually don't just want accuracy. When you're thinking about writing legal briefs, you actually do want creativity because there are different ways to make legal arguments. And maybe the way that you've thought of on your own is not the best way to do it. And maybe if you had a copilot, right? Think of you're writing a legal brief, you're a lawyer, you have a legal, you're writing a legal brief, you have a copilot. Right. And, and that copilot is just giving you ideas, right? And some of the ideas are going to be great idea. Some of the ideas are gonna be terrible ideas, but they're all new ideas, the ideas where you don't have to sit and come up with them on your own. Right? And so what the lawyers are saying basically is like in that case, you actually, you actually, you want some hallucinating, right? You, you, you don't want make up a court case that didn't happen but you want, oh, here's a different way to make the same argument, right? Or, or you might also view it as like if you're writing a closing argument to be presented to a jury like that, you know, as you know, it's like a storytelling exercise. And so you might want actually, you know, some brainstorming, you don't want the thing to do it for you because you're the guy who has to stand up there and actually present it and you have to really be willing to stand behind it, but it might be helpful to have a writing partner that can actually help you do that. And so there, there's this sort of double edged, like the fact that it Hallucinates is both a big problem, but it's also magical because we've never had computers that make things up before. Like that's a brand new thing. If you had told me three years ago, we're gonna have computers that like make up like it's never, it's never happened. There's never been a way to do that. It's the same thing and now you're seeing it, it's the way to see this really clearly. Of course, is visual design, visual art, you know, coming out of like mid journey or da or these things where it will make up all of these crazy art things and you know, look half the time it will make up like it will. And you know, there's this famous thing, they've figured it out now. But for a long time, the way that you could tell that computer art was being made by algorithm was it just, it would give extra fingers, it just turned out that the training data it was trained on. It just like it just turns out like human, human bodies relatively straightforward, except that there are these like detailed finger appendages. And if you are looking at a billion photos or pictures of people, they have fingers in all kinds of different positions. And so the early versions of the A I basically just didn't know how to do fingers accurately. They fix that now, right where it no longer does that. But by the way, if you want it to, it still will, right? And so if you tell it, render me a scene where everybody has seven fingers, it will happily do it for you. And computers never used to be able to do that, right? Or if you just want to tell it to use it, one of the things you can do, it is really fun with these things is you can do it. You can say like use your imagination or, or you can say another thing you can do is you can say, so there's this thing called prompt engineering. So it's how do you write out the prompt that tells the A I what to do, right? So which is true for both a text A I and for an image A I do the prompt. And it turns out there was a research thing done by \\nGoogle\\n a few, a few months back about what's the optimal prompt that, that optimizes the chance that there won't be hallucinations that it's gonna be the most likely to be what's called factually grounded. And it turned out the opal prompt starts with, take a deep breath really gives you the best results, right? And, and, and so, and, and, and this gets to the, the, the amazingness of what's happening.\", metadata={'source': 'sample_transcript.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Speaker 2\\n48:07\\nYeah, look. So, so, and I would say \\nGoogle\\n if it was in this interesting position where number one, they invented a lot of these A I technologies, right? And so the key breakthrough for Chet GP T actually happened at \\nGoogle\\n in 2017 in classic the company form, they sat on it. They didn't, they didn't use it. If you talk to people in \\nGoogle\\n, they will tell you that \\nGoogle\\n could have had GP T chat, GP T for the way you have it today, they could have had it in 2019.
